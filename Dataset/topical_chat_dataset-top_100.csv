3,Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow!,Happy
3,thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats!,Surprised
3,Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,Surprised
3,i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?,Neutral

3,It seems they do. I also didn't know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink.,Surprised
3,thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis?,Neutral

3," I have never been to a cat cafe no, what about you? Seems like they are popular in Japan and Taiwan.",Curious to dive deeper
3,no but I would love to! paying hourly to hang out with adorable cats? im in!,Happy

6," Yes, I think it is the most effective search engine. How about you? Do you use gmail?",Curious to dive deeper
6,Yes. a google search takes more computing power than sending astronauts tot he moon,Surprised

6,do you know how google maps calculates traffic?,Surprised
6," I am not sure, how do they do this?",Curious to dive deeper
6,they track how fast android devices are moving,Curious to dive deeper
6,Interesting! Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity.,Surprised
6,Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years,Curious to dive deeper
6,But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google?,Curious to dive deeper
6,No I have. What does the results turn?,Curious to dive deeper
6,You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean?,Curious to dive deeper
6," Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though",Curious to dive deeper
6," Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield's website. That actually seems more fun.",Surprised
6,I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield,Curious to dive deeper
6," Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea.",Happy
6,Wow. In Japana and Taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them,Curious to dive deeper
6,That seems fun! That reminds me of the Anderson house bed and breakfast in Minnesota. They used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room.,Surprised
6,wow. there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat,Surprised
6," That is cool. Cats are a pretty smart species. There has not been a cat species extinction in 10,000 years.",Surprised

7,Do you like comic books?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I do like comic books!,Happy
7,Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out?,Curious to dive deeper
7," I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with ""excelsior!""",Happy
7,I've heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas.,Happy
7,I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too.,Curious to dive deeper
7,The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars!,Happy
7,That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world?,Curious to dive deeper
7," I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!",Happy
7," That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems. ",Curious to dive deeper
7," I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!",Happy
7," That's pretty wild. Marvel published a ""generic comic book,"" in order to trademark the names ""superhero"" and ""super-villain."" That was pretty smart of them. ",Curious to dive deeper
7,No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe?,Curious to dive deeper
7,I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt.,Curious to dive deeper
7,That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets.,Happy
7,That's really interesting. I've also heard that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,Curious to dive deeper
7,It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn't want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph!,Happy
7,I don't see that being a pleasant place. It's even 2000 degree weather. That sounds like hell to me!,Curious to dive deeper
7,Hahah That's a good way of putting it!,Happy
7," Well I have to get to work, I hope you have a good day. It was nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
8,Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse.,Surprised
8,Its amazing and ever evolving.,Surprised
8,Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away.,Surprised
8,They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see,Neutral
8," Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say. ",Surprised
8,I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure.,Curious to dive deeper
8," Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ...",Surprised
8,There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron?,Curious to dive deeper
8," Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.  ",Surprised
8,It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big.,Disgusted
8,Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?,Curious to dive deeper
8," I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK.",Neutral
8," Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget. ",Happy
8,Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing.,Curious to dive deeper
8,On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books.,Curious to dive deeper
8," I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up. ",Curious to dive deeper
8," Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.  ",Surprised
8," Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both. ",Neutral
8," I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don't think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day. ",Happy
9,Are you a Star Wars fan? I need to rewatch the OT and the prequels so I can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand what's going on.,Curious to dive deeper
9," Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!",Happy
9," Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work.",Curious to dive deeper
9," Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change.",Surprised
9,$7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio.,Neutral
9," Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable!",Surprised
9,A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence.,Neutral
9," Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence!",Neutral
9," I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.",Curious to dive deeper
9,Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious!,Surprised
9,I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like!,Curious to dive deeper
9,I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting!,Neutral
9,I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.,Curious to dive deeper
9," That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory. ",Curious to dive deeper
9," I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. ",Curious to dive deeper
9," Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant!",Neutral
9," Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.",Neutral
9," Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!",Neutral
9," I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL.",Happy
9," Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they're a dog company! That is awesome!",Happy
9," Yeah, that's a weird official policy for what's supposed to be a neutral search engine! Nice chatting with you.",Happy
10," Naming a cloned cat ""copy cat"", that's cute.",Neutral
10,You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US.,Sad
10,Really? That's awful to hear!,Surprised
10,Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena!,Surprised
10," Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover.",Surprised
10," And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets ""OWNER"" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.  ",Surprised
10,I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats.,Curious to dive deeper
10,Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth?,Surprised
10,That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act.",Surprised
10,I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills?",Surprised
10," Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm.",Curious to dive deeper
10,Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.",Happy
10," Yes, like for elderly who are without companions.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?",Surprised
10,I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length!,Surprised
10,That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication!,Curious to dive deeper
10,Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish.,Curious to dive deeper
10,I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish?,Curious to dive deeper
10," That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog",Curious to dive deeper
10,Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time.,Neutral
10," Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period.",Curious to dive deeper
10,Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then...,Curious to dive deeper
10,Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer.,Curious to dive deeper
10,That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone.,Curious to dive deeper
10," Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers.",Curious to dive deeper
10," Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.",Curious to dive deeper
10,One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?,Neutral
10,Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild.,Curious to dive deeper
10,Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals!,Surprised
10,It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you.,Curious to dive deeper
11,I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section.,Sad
11,That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat.,Surprised
11," Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future.",Surprised
11,Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile.,Surprised
11,Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat.,Surprised
11," Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house.",Neutral
11," I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance.",Curious to dive deeper
11,Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on.,Surprised
11,Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.,Surprised
11," That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck!",Disgusted
11," Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish.",Surprised
11," Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15.",Surprised
11," Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real ""teddy"" bear along with a hyena",Curious to dive deeper
11,Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.,Surprised
11," I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It's not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian.",Surprised
11," Lots of places have special animal rights. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",Surprised
11,The loch ness monster is protected by 1912 Scottish provisions,Surprised
11,That's funny. It's not even a proven species. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.,Surprised
11,Did you ever hear of people being contacted due to DNA matches?  You can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members,Curious to dive deeper
11," That is pretty cool. There are several companies offering DNA testing, and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy",Neutral
11,DNA matches could be connected via social media.,Surprised
12," hi, do you like fish?",Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, I love fish do you?",Neutral
12,yes me too. some of them can eat prey twice their sizew,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck?",Neutral
12," that is so cool, and the males carry the young in that species",Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, and zebrafish are very interesting.",Neutral
12,yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes interesting,  How about the first cloned cat named copy cat?",Neutral
12,that is cool. there is a jellyfish that is immortal,Curious to dive deeper
12," I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?",Neutral
12," that is a such a cool fact, we are still evolving so maybe it will eventually go away",Curious to dive deeper
12," lol, interesting to know the loch ness monster is a protected species.",Neutral
12,yet no one has really seen it to confirm its existence,Curious to dive deeper
12," I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets.",Neutral
12,do you know how many idnividual animals are believed to be on earth?,Curious to dive deeper
12," Yes, 20 quintillion, can you believe that?Wow",Surprised
12,I do not even know how many zeros are in that number,Curious to dive deeper
12," lol, I know, I guess  the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia.",Surprised
12,and Roosevelet did not have any of them,Curious to dive deeper
12,He did have a bear and hyena. Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets.,Neutral
12,I like that too. nice chat,Happy
13,Hello,Happy
13,Hello.  do you have a cat?  I see that some people can be allergic to them.,Neutral
13," No, I do not.  I am actually allergic to cats.  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat",Surprised
13," That's interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that?",Neutral
13," Wow, no I didn't know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.",Sad
13,Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets?,Surprised
13," Wow, that's odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats",Curious to dive deeper
13,I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.,Neutral
13,Dogs are my favorite also.  I hope to get another one in the future.,Curious to dive deeper
13,Do you have any now?  I have two.,Curious to dive deeper
13," No, I do not.  What kind do you have?  84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish",Surprised
13,I have a beagle and a border collie.  I had no idea about that with the zebrafish. I wonder if cures can be found by using their genes.,Curious to dive deeper
13,I used to have a collie named Bimbo.  That's a great question.,Curious to dive deeper
13,Mine is named Cute Stuff.  Did you know about the fish that lives on land? I wonder what it is.,Curious to dive deeper
13," No, I didn't.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal",Curious to dive deeper
13,Seriously?  I thought they just evaporated in the sun?,Surprised
13," Absolutely, There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.",Curious to dive deeper
13,And who knows how many that are undiscovered.  Animals are truly fascinating!,Happy
13," Yes, they are.  In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.",Curious to dive deeper
13,I think that is a good thing!  I like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges.,Happy
13,Me too. Thanks for the informative chat.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Hello, Did you know that there are over 1.5 million living animal species?",Curious to dive deeper
14," No, that was chock  full of interesting facts. Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs? Interesting stuff.",Surprised
14," Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight.",Curious to dive deeper
14,I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet.,Surprised
14," Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish. ",Curious to dive deeper
14," I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that.",Surprised
14,Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today.",Surprised
14,I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.,Curious to dive deeper
14," While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights?",Surprised
14,Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin.",Curious to dive deeper
14," If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish. ",Curious to dive deeper
14,I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research?,Surprised
14," If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny.",Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me.",Neutral
14,Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it?",Neutral
14," Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? ",Curious to dive deeper
14," Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?",Neutral
14,Some animals just should be domesticated. That white patch if true is something to ponder.,Curious to dive deeper
14," Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend.",Curious to dive deeper
14,You as well!!,Curious to dive deeper
14,Thanks.,Happy
15," hey hows it going, do you know what the first cloned animal was?",Curious to dive deeper
15," Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny!",Curious to dive deeper
15," haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia",Surprised
15," Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag?",Curious to dive deeper
15," no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag?",Curious to dive deeper
15,I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico.,Sad
15," ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen",Curious to dive deeper
15," They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you?",Happy
15," no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such",Curious to dive deeper
15," In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though.",Surprised
15," hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, ""Guardians"" haha",Surprised
15," Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets. Shrug. Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy. It's unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned. Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger. ",Sad
15," ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha",Curious to dive deeper
15,Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems.,Sad
15," haha ya, well I am like the black swallower fish, I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it",Happy
15,Funny. I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal.,Curious to dive deeper
15,I know they need to apply those genes to me! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck,Curious to dive deeper
15,So seahorses are salt water right? I guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin.,Surprised
15," yes that would be true, also true is that 84% of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish, we need to study that fish too!",Surprised
15,How odd! Do you think the loch ness monster is real? It is a protected species!,Surprised
15," haha I wish it were real! that's funny they did that in 1912, maybe they knew something that we dont?",Surprised
16,What would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag?,Curious to dive deeper
16," I would look around to make sure Mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with, ""Gimme back my child"" look!",Happy
16," LOL yep you don't want to be around an angry tiger mom haha. I guess they found one on the southern Border in Texas, a bag with a baby tiger that is",Surprised
16,Was it a smuggling thing?,Curious to dive deeper
16,Yes I think so unfortunately. the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately,Sad
16," With 20 quintillion animals in this world, why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one?",Happy
16," Haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts, I don't think a mosquito is worth anything LOL. Why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads?",Curious to dive deeper
16," Once domesticated, animals develop white patches on their foreheads, likely because once indoors, they run into painted walls and doors with their heads. I know i do.",Happy
16,Haha I wonder if humans developed these white patches as well. What do you think about Germany giving constitutional rights to animals? They did that back in 2002,Surprised
16," I think German constitutional right for animals are pretty cool. Pretty, pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film, ""12 angry hamsters""",Happy
16," Well I'll have to watch that movie. I just think it's cool that hiccups are relics of When Animals had both lungs and gills, so next time you have the hiccups think about that LOL",Surprised
16,Does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster! I'm glad  she is a protected species. Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda.,Happy
16," It's funny that it's protected by 1912 Scottish law, the ""protection of animals act"". hopefully that means that it's a real animal LOL but I doubt it",Surprised
16," Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck. ",Happy
16,That is crazy! I also think it's crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die AKA its immortal,Surprised
16," Does that mean they never get cancer, or they get cancer forever? You know, 84% of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish, but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson's disease...",Happy
16," Haha I haven't seen it either! Maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease, because black swallow fish Can Eat Prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha",Surprised
16," Haha. If  freshwater fish can drink through it's skin, why don't you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita?",Happy
16,Haha I wish I could drink through my skin and float in a margarita LOL. Do you have any pets by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
16," Too many to count. We've had Hamsters, snakes, scorpions, lizards, fish, cats, dogs, chickens, birds...Our apartment is getting cramped...",Happy
16," Haha that's a lot of animals! We have a dog actually, but I can't believe that there are more pet tigers in the USA than Wild Ones in Asia, a lot of people must have illegal pets here",Surprised
17,Can you recommend any movies to watch?,Curious to dive deeper
17,Do you like Star Wars ? The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix.,Curious to dive deeper
17,Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo?,Neutral
17," Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ?",Curious to dive deeper
17,Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role,Neutral
17," He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie. ",Neutral
17,Does Chewbacca appear in this movie?,Neutral
17," Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much. ",Neutral
17,I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend,Happy
17,In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons.,Neutral
17,Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of,Surprised
17," I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it. ",Neutral
17,I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help. There's a giant fictional Universe that could be filled.,Curious to dive deeper
17,Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ?,Neutral
17,I think it would be interesting. There are also so many comic stories that could be told. I just wonder how communication would work in such a movie,Curious to dive deeper
17," They would use subtitles. And good storytelling, like how Hans Solo seems to understand Chewie's intentions, but not his words. ",Neutral
17,Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend. But able to shoot things,Neutral
17,There was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L. about a robot dog.,Neutral
17,I will have to check that one out as well. Thanks for your time. have a good day,Neutral
17," Do you like dogs ? I love them, they were one of the first domesticated animals.",Neutral
17,Yes! dogs and elephants can understand pointing,Happy
18,Good Morning! How are you today?,Curious to dive deeper
18," Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump.",Curious to dive deeper
18,I couldn't have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago!,Curious to dive deeper
18," I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference,",Surprised
18,A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease!,Curious to dive deeper
18," People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such.",Sad
18,I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?,Curious to dive deeper
18," I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene.",Curious to dive deeper
18,Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh?,Curious to dive deeper
18," There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural.  I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view.",Curious to dive deeper
18,I agree too! I can't believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha.,Curious to dive deeper
18," That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more.",Happy
18," All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too.....",Curious to dive deeper
18," Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat's in general? ",Curious to dive deeper
18," I wear hats when I'm out hiking, but that is about it, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
18," Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat.",Neutral
18,It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn't that the most popular hat in the old west too?,Curious to dive deeper
18," I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.",Happy
18,Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from!,Curious to dive deeper
18,Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.,Happy
18," Or just when he is walking around being the odd self he is. Anyways, I had a great chat with you, have an awesome day!",Curious to dive deeper
19,Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions!,Curious to dive deeper
19,I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off.,Neutral
19," Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment.",Curious to dive deeper
19,I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank.,Surprised
19," Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler!",Surprised
19,Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that.,Surprised
19,Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them!,Happy
19,That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order?,Curious to dive deeper
19,Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps!,Curious to dive deeper
19,That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange.,Surprised
19,Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance.,Curious to dive deeper
19," I'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest. Speaking of rap, do you know what Eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper?",Curious to dive deeper
19,I didn't know that. Very interesting. Rappers also have some odd beliefs. Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.,Surprised
19,Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist. Kanye West is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas.,Curious to dive deeper
19,Yes he is. But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert.,Happy
19,That was nice of him. Did you know that Busta Rhymes did voice work in an animated movie?,Curious to dive deeper
19,Oh yeah you're right. He was the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats Movie!,Surprised
19,Yes he was. He has a distinct voice so I don't know how I missed it initially.,Surprised
19,Good point. I didn't know rap was popular in Korea. They created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle! Well thanks for talking with me today!,Curious to dive deeper
19,I didn't know that either. That has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here. It was nice talking with you as well.,Surprised
19,Yes here they are much more agressive! Have a good one!,Happy
20,did you see that Kanye is having another kid?,Neutral
20,I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :),Neutral
20,I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I'd want a whole lot more than that!,Curious to dive deeper
20," ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...",Curious to dive deeper
20," Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person.",Curious to dive deeper
20,ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ?,Curious to dive deeper
20," Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though.",Surprised
20,I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world...,Curious to dive deeper
20," I wouldn't doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha)",Neutral
20," lol ;) no, not really... I don't consider it to be music ;)",Curious to dive deeper
20,I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type.,Surprised
20,Doesn't music needs melody ? ;),Surprised
20,Lots of rap does have that!,Disgusted
20,a sample on keyboard doesn't count ;),Surprised
20,I'm thinking you haven't heard much more than whats on the radio then,Surprised
20," Maybe You're right, I don't want to argue ;) not my cup of tea though :) I'm more of a blues fan. Classic rock, maybe metal. ;)",Curious to dive deeper
20,I'll pretty much listen to anything except country.  It is god awful,Curious to dive deeper
20,I don't listen to country but I don't mind it. It has it's own charm and it takes skills to play and sing country...,Curious to dive deeper
20,I suppose.  Just like most music what is played on the radio is just garbage,Disgusted
20,I agree... I mean I haven't heard anything new that's good. Maybe except Black Country Communion... great band,Curious to dive deeper
20,Can't say I know them!,Surprised
21,Do you like rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
21," I do, but I cannot tolerate Kanye West. I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant.",Curious to dive deeper
21," I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease. ",Curious to dive deeper
21," I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style.",Curious to dive deeper
21," That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist?",Curious to dive deeper
21," Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie.",Curious to dive deeper
21,I didn't know that either. That's pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle?,Curious to dive deeper
21," The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that. I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler.",Curious to dive deeper
21," Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren't they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons?",Curious to dive deeper
21," I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the ""tip of the hat"" originates from Knights raising their visors.",Neutral
21,That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins.,Curious to dive deeper
21," They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move.",Neutral
21,Yeah it is. I'd hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin.,Curious to dive deeper
21,That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities.,Neutral
21,Yeah he does have a few. He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows....2 years before the infamous Taylor Swift incident.,Curious to dive deeper
21," I have no idea what that is, as I don't pay attention to her either. I still find it mindblowing that Big Sean turned down a scholarship to Michigan, to go rap.",Disgusted
21," Yeah that is pretty good. He made a good choice I guess, he's one of the biggest rappers in the world right now. He can always go back. ",Curious to dive deeper
21," Big Sean is? Weird, most have never heard of him. I do like Kanye's middle name, Omari,. ",Neutral
21,So his initials are K.O.W. That's funny!,Curious to dive deeper
21," I love the skits Saturday Night Live does of trump. The one of Brett Kavanaugh was hilarious, have you seen it?",Curious to dive deeper
21,Yes it was hilarious!,Curious to dive deeper
21," Thank you for chatting with me, have a nice day.",Neutral
21," I enjoyed it, I hope you have a nice day as well. ",Curious to dive deeper
22,Hello.  Did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate?,Neutral
22," haha yeah, I heard about that. It's been there since 1968.",Happy
22,I guess they all like candy a lot!  At least it's american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania.,Neutral
22,What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey?,Curious to dive deeper
22," They've got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans!",Neutral
22," Wow, that's way cooler than the fact that they didn't let women wear pants until 1993.",Surprised
22,I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor.,Neutral
22," They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha.",Happy
22,Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked.,Neutral
22," Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards",Happy
22,I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers!,Neutral
22," Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected. They weren't elected until 1913.",Curious to dive deeper
22,Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy.,Neutral
22,I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years.,Neutral
22,Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway.,Neutral
22,We should just have people voted in by lottery. That's what Athens used to do.,Disgusted
22,It almost seems as if that is what we have now.  I think more states than just Nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots.,Neutral
22," Yeah, hopefully we'll see some electoral reform soon, hopefully we can see this will improve fairness.",Neutral
22,Speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the UK could vote until 1918?,Neutral
22," nope. But, I did hear that astronauts can vote from space.",Happy
22,That is amazing and very determined.  It's like India setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions!,Neutral
23,Hi are you a fan of Star Wars?,Curious to dive deeper
23," My son is, so I know a little bit about it.",Neutral
23,Nice!  Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977?  I remember going to the theater to see it.,Curious to dive deeper
23," No, I did not.  My son went with his friends. Apparently, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013.",Curious to dive deeper
23,There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that's for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars!,Happy
23,20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed.  Do you know what happened to Star Wars' licensing and merchandising rights?,Curious to dive deeper
23,Didn't George Lucas get them somehow?,Curious to dive deeper
23," Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas. ",Curious to dive deeper
23,Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars!,Happy
23," 20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $500k to Lucas.  They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him.  Someone got fired at the company, I'll bet.",Curious to dive deeper
23,You know it!  George Lucas' wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film!,Happy
23," I heard about it.  She was talented.  By the way,  Marcia is no longer married to Lucas.",Neutral
23,Whoa!  I didn't know that.  Maybe George doesn't have as much as that $65 billion as I thought.  Yikes.,Happy
23," It's okay.  Marcia is entitled to the money too.  She want the award, remember?",Neutral
23,Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie.,Happy
23," Sorry, what I meant was ""she won the award"". About James Earl Jones - I think he was only paid $7500 for his work.  That was not fair.",Curious to dive deeper
23,Wow.  That sure doesn't.  I wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for Darth Vader?  On a different subject....did you know that Earth's surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land?,Curious to dive deeper
23,I did not know the exact percentages.  Thanks for the info!,Neutral
23,On a sad note relating to those percentages....more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?,Happy
23,I heard about it and we need to do something about it.,Curious to dive deeper
23,I agree.  It's sad.  I had a good time chatting with you tonight!,Happy
23,I thank you for your information - I learned a lot from you.  Have a good night.,Happy
24,Hey! Are you a Star Wars fan? I love George Lucas for creating such a cool storyline.,Happy
24,Hello! I do like Star Wars! I can't believe companies thought it would be a flop!,Surprised
24,Yeah can you believe that? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion.,Surprised
24," I'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2!",Curious to dive deeper
24,Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is?,Curious to dive deeper
24,Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it?,Surprised
24,Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director.,Happy
24,I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not!,Curious to dive deeper
24,Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor.,Surprised
24,I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn't even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn't read music!,Curious to dive deeper
24," That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics.",Surprised
24," Wow, and now it seems like it's all computerized graphics! Speaking of crazy, isn't earth awesome?",Curious to dive deeper
24,Yes earth is epic indeed! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! But that was a very long time ago!,Surprised
24,I feel like I would never be able to catch up on sleep during that time lol. I wonder at what point will earth's days be like 40 hours haha.,Curious to dive deeper
24,Yeah I've wondered that as well. I don't look forward to working that long! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century. No more balloons for us!,Curious to dive deeper
24," I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha. We do have to thank Jupiter though, they save us from many asteroids coming our way!",Curious to dive deeper
24,Do they really? I'm not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed.,Sad
24,That is so sad! We are destroying the planet we live on! That is even more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways!,Curious to dive deeper
24," Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!",Neutral
24," I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!",Curious to dive deeper
24,You as well. Goodbye now!,Neutral
25," Hello, How are you? Do you like politics?",Curious to dive deeper
25," Im well.  I do like politics, I just find our current climate a bit hostile.",Neutral
25," lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?",Surprised
25,I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates.,Neutral
25,I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%?,Surprised
25," yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican",Neutral
25," Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too!",Happy
25," They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election",Neutral
25,Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government!,Happy
25," I know, id be skipping out on that election.",Neutral
25,I think I would too! Too bad Richard Nixon cracked that 165 year old gavel the senate used. It must be somewhere on display.,Curious to dive deeper
25," Yeah, that has to be a piece of US history.",Neutral
25,Love the candy desk idea at the senate! Now I'm going to think about them going thru that drawer full of milky ways . mars bars and jelly beans!,Curious to dive deeper
25,It does sound like the best idea ever.  All that candy is made in Pennsylvania too.,Neutral
25," Yes, keep their sugar levels up!! lol",Happy
25,Keep them working.  LOL,Neutral
25," Yeah, can't make good choices when your sugar has dropped!  It can't believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor. ",Surprised
25," I know.  If I were elected, I would be doing that first day.  Actually, Id probably bring up senate pajama day.  I m all about the comfort.",Neutral
25,I am too. Nothing worse than trying to work and feeling uncomfortable!! Good chat!!,Neutral
25,For real!  Have a good one!,Neutral
25,You too! Have a good night!!,Happy
26,Do you know much about politics?,Curious to dive deeper
26,Just the basics mostly.  Do you know what the 'candy desk' tradition is about?,Curious to dive deeper
26," I've heard one of the Senators keeps candy in their desk. Pretty cool! Did you know that Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time?",Surprised
26," What! No, I did not know that, that is very interesting. ",Surprised
26," Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election. ",Surprised
26," That is crazy, but understandable.  And you are right, gives us no excuse.  Did you know about Jordan's political dealings?",Curious to dive deeper
26,I don't. Tell me more.,Curious to dive deeper
26," He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny. ",Happy
26," Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections.",Surprised
26,Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.,Neutral
26,The voter turnout for us presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years! That's actually more than I would guess.,Surprised
26," Well, we'll see how voting will be done twenty years from now, if they make it easier, the numbers will probably rise. ",Curious to dive deeper
26,That's true. Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918.,Surprised
26,I wonder how much fraud there was in voting back in 1918.,Curious to dive deeper
26," I'm sure a lot. Elections are fairly new. rom 1789 until 1913, Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, they are now popularly elected. ",Surprised
26,That is a very interesting fact.  Do you remember the first time you voted?,Curious to dive deeper
26,I don't. it was a long time ago! Women were not allowed to wear pants on the u.s. senate floor until 1993.,Surprised
26,I think that is the strangest fact of the day.  I think it's wild when observers have to be blocked from polls during elections.,Curious to dive deeper
26,Strange and freaky! dian government sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter.,Surprised
26,I think I've read that before! Wild to think about.,Curious to dive deeper
26,Nice chatting with you. Thanks!,Curious to dive deeper
27," Hey how are you, can't believe that Georgia senator got arrested!",Curious to dive deeper
27,She said she was peacefully chanting.,Sad
27," That's interesting, I wish voting was different now, no reason to still have ballots with no federal holiday for Election Day.",Curious to dive deeper
27,It's interesting that astronauts vote from space!,Surprised
27," For sure, I wonder if it's confidential up there? How does it get back to earth?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Right, I'll have to look that up. Indian government sets up a polling booth in a  forest that is full of lions for just one voter.",Surprised
27," I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Yes I did. And even though we don't have to go to a forest full of lions, voter turnout for US presidential elections has not reached 62.8 percent in the last 100 years.",Surprised
27," That's crazy, I wonder if they'll ever fix that, plenty of things they can do about that but never attempt it. ",Curious to dive deeper
27,Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election. Hope that's just a coincidence!,Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's pretty crazy. I'm 6'4"", I should run for president lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
27," Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.",Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's some forward thinking. What is an oligarchy again?",Curious to dive deeper
27,It is where power is concentrated in a small group of people.,Surprised
27," Ah I gotcha, they're kind of right I'm sure. I wonder what the perfect government system is? Any ideas?",Curious to dive deeper
27," Not sure I have faith in any, as all great civilizations come to an end. It seems like we are still barely progressing though. Women could not wear pants in the US senate floor until 1993 after a couple of women senators protested by wearing pantsuits.",Surprised
27," Oh wow, that's crazy how sexist they still were. I agree about the great civilizations coming to an end, they all thought they'd be around forever too.",Curious to dive deeper
27," I think it's interesting that astronauts vote from space. Yet, we have low turnouts for presidential elections for those of us on earth, haha.",Surprised
27," For sure, I wonder why people don't show up so much, I wish they would more!",Curious to dive deeper
27," Yeah, the Indian government set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter, that is pretty neat.",Surprised
27," Very cool. Great chatting with you, I'm going to take off though, take care!",Curious to dive deeper
28,did you watch the movie Frozen?,Curious to dive deeper
28," I did and loved it so much, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
28,me too. Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman?,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing",Curious to dive deeper
28,I know. Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad",Curious to dive deeper
28,That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yeah. DO you have a pet?,Curious to dive deeper
28,I have two cats and a dog. DO you like dogs?,Curious to dive deeper
28,I love dogs. did you there they can have one of the 12 blood types?,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and there are blood drives for dogs,Curious to dive deeper
28,So cool. In istanbul they have installed water and food dispensers for dogs,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes such a genius idea and it helps everyone involved,Curious to dive deeper
28,I know. Dogs are really good at understanding pointing,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yes and same goes for the elephants as well,Curious to dive deeper
28,Yeah. Google is a dog company it seems,Curious to dive deeper
28," Yes they have that in their code of conduct, talk about dedication",Curious to dive deeper
28," I know right, dogs deserve that though",Curious to dive deeper
29,Do you like baseball ?,Curious to dive deeper
29,I have heard of it. Do you?,Neutral
29," I like, the sport but there is not MLB team in my city, so I don't watch it. But I find it really interesting, full of small details, like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to. ",Surprised
29," That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager. Nowadays, it wouldn't work.",Neutral
29," Yes, I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them, like some could have an heart attack.  ",Neutral
29," Yeah, no insurance company would touch the managers on the field, that's for sure.",Neutral
29," I think they would be better at softball, did you ever watch a softball game ? ",Curious to dive deeper
29," I have never watched a softball game, though I understand many women play it. ",Neutral
29," I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more. ",Neutral
29," Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means. ",Neutral
29," Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.   ",Neutral
29,Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport.,Neutral
29," Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches. ",Neutral
29," Their is a physicality to what they do, but it's just in the hands.",Neutral
29," As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal. Do you play video games ?",Curious to dive deeper
29,I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you?,Curious to dive deeper
29," Me too, I have lost interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me  not to buy the next console. It is the more and more popular, 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth. ",Sad
29,Wow. So much time on games. I guess it's about the same as time spent watching TV.,Neutral
29," Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.",Neutral
29,It is important to keep the kids from losing themselves in the games. Which countries restrict video games?,Curious to dive deeper
29," There is Korea limiting kids under 16, and China I think. Mostly Asian countries. ",Neutral
29," The kids there go nuts over games. I know that there are pro gamers in Korea. Anyway, fun chat!",Happy
29," You too, have a good evening.",Neutral
30,Hi there are you a baseball fan?,Curious to dive deeper
30,i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You?,Neutral
30,I'm a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed.,Happy
30,I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager.,Neutral
30,I'm not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80's.  He played every day and managed at the same time.,Happy
30," yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player.",Neutral
30,Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing.,Happy
30," Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig.",Neutral
30,Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don't think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940's.  He hit the jackpot.,Happy
30," Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do?",Neutral
30,I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol,Happy
30," Yeah, that is quite lucky. Do you follow softball at all?",Neutral
30,I actually enjoy watching college softball on ESPNU!,Happy
30,Really? the womens game? do men play as well?,Neutral
30," lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings!",Happy
30," Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000.",Neutral
30,No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I've watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day.,Happy
30,He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball.,Neutral
30,Check it out on youtube.  I was shocked at how far the balls go. lol  Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada! lol It's been fun chatting!,Happy
30," Yes, it has been fun chatting! Have a good weekend!",Neutral
30,You have a great weekend too!,Happy
31," Hi, how are you doing this fine evening?",Neutral
31,Hey there I'm doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen?,Curious to dive deeper
31," I haven't seen it. Is it a good film? It's animated, right? With lots of songs?",Curious to dive deeper
31," Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen",Curious to dive deeper
31,HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards?,Curious to dive deeper
31," I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character",Surprised
31,that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film?,Neutral
31," There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman.",Surprised
31,Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent.,Neutral
31,I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set,Surprised
31," Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well.",Neutral
31,Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves,Curious to dive deeper
31," A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though.",Neutral
31," Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist",Curious to dive deeper
31,I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice.,Neutral
31,I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash?,Surprised
31,The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward.,Neutral
31,Oh for sure! One other thing I didn't know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha!,Happy
31,Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you!,Neutral
31,I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha,Happy
31,Have a good night,Neutral
31," Thanks you too! And watch out for dogs, they're not actually colorblind but they just don't see as many colors as a normal human can",Surprised
32," Ana Gloria Henrequez was from Salvador, trying to get to USA, trying to escape from misery and gangs in El Salvador. She was caught.",Sad
32," Yeah, I heard about that. I feel horrible for her young daughter",Sad
32," Sorry, Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother, my bad. Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy. They said that they never had been caught until Trump's laws.",Sad
32," Yeah, I'm not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult",Sad
32," Yes, I know. I don't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members.",Sad
32," It's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena's voice. I guess since I've never been a parent, I can't comprehend that",Sad
32,You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid.,Sad
32,I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school,Happy
32," Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don't know, this is a very difficult situation.",Sad
32," Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie",Sad
32," Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don't have any safety.",Sad
32,I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago!,Surprised
32,I wonder why people are adopting them. Praying for them. Have you seen Frozen?,Sad
32,Many are adopting the kids because they want to give them safe homes!,Surprised
32," Oh, then, thank you very much. Glad to know about this. God bless them. Well, I liked a lot Frozen. Is a fiery Princess.",Happy
32," yes, it was great movie. And there's a sequel coming out. I can't wait!",Happy
32," Hahaha, liked the graphics, tooo!  Do you like dogs? I didn't know that among dogs they have 12 different blood types!!!!!!!",Surprised
32," Yes, and they even have doggy blood drives ^_^ Did the male love interest have a dog or a horse in Frozen? I can't remember...",Curious to dive deeper
32," Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse's name is really Minerva.",Surprised
32," Really?! Like the Greek goddess? That's fascinating to me. Usually Disney tries to ""de-feminize"" things rather than feminize them more. Frozen was supposed to be named Snow Queen but boys often don't see movies that have feminine nouns in the title :/",Neutral
32," hahahaah that is so much male, lol. Nice to meet you, giving to you an excellent, have a nice day!",Happy
32,Have a lovely day as well :),Neutral
33," Hello my Friend?! Are you a fan of ""Frozen"" the movie? I personally Looooved it!",Curious to dive deeper
33,I have not seen the movie. Is it animated? Is it for kids?,Neutral
33," both! lol, although Im not a kid so I guess for all haha, I did take my kids to see the movie though. It came out in 2013 and earned over 1 billion dollars",Curious to dive deeper
33," That's great! I must be a wonderful film. It's a disney film, yes? Lots of songs?",Neutral
33," That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?",Curious to dive deeper
33,I have not. I guess the story is basically the same as the fairy tale? Girl with long hair in a tower?,Neutral
33," Yes, another of my favorites! How about you? What do you like to watch?",Curious to dive deeper
33," I enjoy watching comedies and dramas. I sometimes watch animated stuff, but not usually.",Neutral
33," Me too, Mysteries or psychological thrillers are great, but animated is one of my favs to watch with kiddos although everyone knows Minnie mouse did you know minnie is short for minerva?! mind blown",Curious to dive deeper
33," I did not know that. I'm not surprised that Disney makes about $1,110 per second. That's a lot, but reflects the success of the brand.",Neutral
33,Oh my! thats awesome! I guess im not too surprised since the company was founded in 1923!,Curious to dive deeper
33,Almost 100 years old. The Mouse House will soon have a century behind it.,Neutral
33," Wow, well its maintained its popularity very well! I mean there is a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in all things disney",Curious to dive deeper
33," I've never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It's part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers.",Neutral
33," Yes, and thus I'm not surprised they're so succesful. That's very creative and engaging, and keeps viewers interested and coming back... genius!",Curious to dive deeper
33,It's ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for ''not being creative enough.'' I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time.,Neutral
33," Wow! well see, that's why I believe in perfect timing sometimes there are better opportunities ahead of us. amazing! ",Curious to dive deeper
33,Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and  reason better than chimps.,Neutral
33,Yes! I sometimes Love them better than people... they are just full of Love. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and dog can donate blood at dog blood drives! I love them even more!,Curious to dive deeper
33,That's great! They also have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem  to obtain a reward. Much like people!,Neutral
33," Yes and they understand by pointing! How cool is that? Thats how I get my dog to get my slippers! Anyway, fun chatting with you! Namaste :)",Curious to dive deeper
33,Have a good evening!,Neutral
33,you too,Curious to dive deeper
34," I have never heard of Fanfest,",Happy
34,Hey! What is FanFest? lol,Curious to dive deeper
34," I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol",Happy
34,Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games?,Neutral
34," No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military",Surprised
34,It could be for training purpose. I'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It's quite strange.,Surprised
34,it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12,Surprised
34," after or before 12? If after 12, why is it so? I used to play a lot when I was child. I'm not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood.",Curious to dive deeper
34,But would you categorize them as an art form?,Happy
34,Interesting question. I don't think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What's your opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
34," I really not did get into them, But I would consider them an art form",Curious to dive deeper
34," It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games.",Neutral
34," Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels, can you throw well",Curious to dive deeper
34,Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball?,Neutral
34," I only play have you heard of any of these players like, Davey Johnson?",Curious to dive deeper
34," Yes. He played in 1970s, right? Or maybe 1960s... I don't remember.",Curious to dive deeper
34," I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers.",Happy
34," Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha ",Neutral
34,maybe you should go to the show you can get a medal Maybe,Surprised
34,Medal would be too much significant achievement. The Chicago Cubs were the first to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since. My luck is about the same lol,Neutral
34,Thank you for your time but I must go now,Surprised
34,Have a good day! Thanks.,Neutral
34,bye,Surprised
34,bye!,Neutral
35,Hey how are you? Did you see the FanFest in Miami last year by chance?,Curious to dive deeper
35," No I didn't see that. It's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yah, it was pretty cool. I didn't catch who the olympic gold medalists were, did you? They said there were two of them there.",Surprised
35," No I didn't catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don't watch sports or the Olympics so I can't say that I know any of the names LOL",Neutral
35," Me neither, I wish I knew more about the olympians, they're so elite. Hard for them to get a lot of recognition though. You play video games by chance?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yes I play video games somewhat, used to play Maurice a kid but I don't play that many these days. What about you? I'm just glad that I didn't grow up in South Korea because apparently playing a video game after midnight if your under 16 is illegal",Surprised
35," Oh wow, I would have never of guessed that. I played a lot of video games growing up, I think there is a lot of benefit to them. I play Fortnite now, and I'm in my 30s lol. Do you still play?",Curious to dive deeper
35,LOL I have heard of the game but I have never played it. I do know that they did a study and apparently as a planet we play about 3 billion hours of video games a week so I definitely should be playing more perhaps haha,Surprised
35," I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.",Curious to dive deeper
35," Well I really liked the Nintendo 64 and I also like the original Xbox, it's interesting that I played a Toy Story game back in the day and it wasn't actually Tom Hanks who did the voice but his brother Jim Hanks",Surprised
35," Wow, I'm surprised they have such similar voices. I went the Sega to Playstation route, still rocking the PS4, no Toy Story game though.",Curious to dive deeper
35,Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool. I'm just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL,Happy
35," I like video game a lot more than Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices lol, dang military always overcomplicating things.",Curious to dive deeper
35," I agree with you. Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry Potter? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games, his name is Stephen Fry",Surprised
35,Stephen Fry from Top Gear?,Curious to dive deeper
35," I'm not sure if it's the same guy, I don't know Top Gear personally, but it could be, do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV?",Curious to dive deeper
35," I hear Stephen Fry's name all the time, he must be super famous in the UK. I don't, you going to spit some softball knowledge my way?",Curious to dive deeper
35," Haha yes I can do that. It's interesting that the softball is bigger than a baseball because it is about 12 in in circumference, I've never played softball but that seems like a really big ball lol",Surprised
35," Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?",Curious to dive deeper
35," No I've never seen one actually. It's interesting though that the average salary for a professional softball player is at most $6,000 LOL definitely you're not retiring on that money",Surprised
35," Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!",Curious to dive deeper
35," Yes it's been an excellent chat! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile, they are actually pretty fun",Happy
36," Hi, how are you?",Curious to dive deeper
36,Good! You?  Are you into Fiction at all?,Neutral
36,A little and I prefer non-fiction. Do you like it?,Curious to dive deeper
36," I read mainly non fiction too,  but I can get in to some of it. I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.",Curious to dive deeper
36," I find that useful too! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg, the oldest example of it.",Surprised
36," Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention.",Neutral
36,Me too. Julius Ceasar wrote fan fiction too!,Surprised
36,Wow.  Id like to see what came out of his mind!,Neutral
36,I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus. George RR MArtin would not have liked that!,Fearful
36," Yeah, he things it is copyright infringement.  I dont exactly agree with that.",Neutral
36,I don't either. Imagine being the racist judge who tried to ban a comic book because of a black guy in it.,Surprised
36,That is really kind of ridiculous.  I cant even believe that happens.,Neutral
36,I know. I cannot believe people want to upload their minds to computers!,Surprised
36,That is odd.  I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere.,Neutral
36,There's a reason I buried my skeletons deep! I wonder if it runs on water like the Russians did in 1936?,Curious to dive deeper
36," Yeah, that is pretty fascinating.  I wonder why we arent exploring that technology more.",Curious to dive deeper
36,They were too busy building a 16-bit computer using minecraft blocks!,Curious to dive deeper
36,I cant believe that was even possible.  I thought minecraft was just a game.  That is crazy,Neutral
36,Right? I wonder who built it too? I wish my son could do that stuff. But not smoking. Smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty.,Surprised
36," Good thing I never smoked near mine.  They think it makes it a ""biohazard""",Neutral
36,Agreed! Nice chatting with you!,Happy
37," hey there, do you go out and vote during elections?",Curious to dive deeper
37," Hello there, I do like to get out and vote, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
37,me too. do you know way back then though how people were appointed in ancient athens?,Surprised
37,I guess they were appointed by a lottery of some type.  I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy.,Curious to dive deeper
37,I wonder how that would work today though.,Curious to dive deeper
37," Yeah I don't think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows. ",Curious to dive deeper
37,yeah there is no knowing there. In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options in the ballot.,Surprised
37,Yeah I heard that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year.,Curious to dive deeper
37,I did not know about that one. not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote,Surprised
37," Isn't that pretty sad, I guess it hasn't breached that 63% barrier in the last 100 years!",Curious to dive deeper
37,yes it is because it is a right and we are not using it to its best.,Surprised
37,That is true.  Did you know that the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time?,Curious to dive deeper
37,hahaa I really wonder if that has any correlation with how people perceive the candidates,Surprised
37," Yeah I guess it must, because that is just way too high to just be chance. ",Curious to dive deeper
37,did you hear that international electoral observers were blocked from polls in nine states in 2012,Surprised
37," No I didn't hear that, I wonder why they stopped doing that? ",Curious to dive deeper
37," maybe they did not trust them, i have no idea. do you know when republicans and democrats started using red and blue?",Surprised
37," No I don't, but probably more than 100 years ago or so, do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
37,It was actually as recently as 2000 so not very long ago.,Curious to dive deeper
37," Really, wow I am really bad at politics I guess.  ",Surprised
37,I did not know it either until now. It was nice chatting with you.,Happy
38,Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten,Curious to dive deeper
38," It is one of those that I feel like I don't always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational!",Surprised
38," Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius",Curious to dive deeper
38," There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")!",Surprised
38," Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems?",Curious to dive deeper
38," I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem?",Curious to dive deeper
38," Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid",Curious to dive deeper
38,Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially.,Surprised
38," I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction,",Curious to dive deeper
38,That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic!,Disgusted
38," That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero",Curious to dive deeper
38," Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like.",Surprised
38," I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good.",Curious to dive deeper
38," Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all!",Neutral
38," Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot?",Curious to dive deeper
38," It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days.",Fearful
38," I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence.",Curious to dive deeper
38," Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point.",Neutral
38," I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good  to know, seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that, ",Curious to dive deeper
38," Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.  I do wonder what sort of ""computer"" that was though.",Neutral
38," I wonder if they still make computers that ran on water, not sure is the best idea to mix water with tech",Curious to dive deeper
39,Do you like to use computers?,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes I love computers. I can't imagine my life without one. In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water.,Curious to dive deeper
39," Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water. ",Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty.,Curious to dive deeper
39," Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone?",Curious to dive deeper
39,I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!,Curious to dive deeper
39," That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you? ",Curious to dive deeper
39,I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination!,Curious to dive deeper
39,I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?,Curious to dive deeper
39,I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks.,Surprised
39," Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I'm not even sure how that is possible? ",Curious to dive deeper
39,Me neither. I also don't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM.,Curious to dive deeper
39,I'm not sure either. It seems like a small amount of ram.,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes it does. Do you like reading fiction? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history or facts.,Curious to dive deeper
39,I'm not a huge fan of fiction. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers?,Curious to dive deeper
39,I would like to see that. Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction.,Curious to dive deeper
39,That would be pretty cool. I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki?,Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early.,Curious to dive deeper
39,Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
39,A judge in the 1950s tried to ban a work of science fiction because it featured a black character. Glad times have changed. Nice talking to you too!,Curious to dive deeper
39,Nice chatting with you too!,Happy
40,Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times.,Curious to dive deeper
40," Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you?",Neutral
40,I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.,Curious to dive deeper
40,I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related.,Neutral
40," Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy.",Curious to dive deeper
40," I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?",Neutral
40,I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome!,Neutral
40," that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.",Neutral
40,Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven.,Curious to dive deeper
40," He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him.",Neutral
40,Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal.,Curious to dive deeper
40," Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them. ",Neutral
40," That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre?",Happy
40,I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world.,Neutral
40,That's good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he's coming from.,Curious to dive deeper
40," the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's. ",Neutral
40,Exactly. I think it's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations.,Surprised
40," Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different.",Neutral
40,Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon.,Neutral
40," What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting!",Neutral
40,Ha ha that is very important information I need to know too! Have a good afternoon.,Curious to dive deeper
41," Hello there, do you use Amazon?",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yes, I like Amazon, I like their movie site and their purchase website.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah I use their delivery service quite a bit, especially around Christmas. ",Curious to dive deeper
41," Amazon is a super large company, did you know chief executive own the Washington Post?",Curious to dive deeper
41,No I didn't know that.  Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for?,Curious to dive deeper
41," No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase?",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves.,Curious to dive deeper
41," Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways. I like seen them on TV, but not in real life.",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yeah I only know a little bit, I do know that because they have no bones on land, a sharks weight would crush its own body. ",Curious to dive deeper
41," most people think that all sharks are killer sharks, but I read that all shark aren't killer sharks. Have you seen the movies about sharks?",Curious to dive deeper
41," No, just tv shows about them.  I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting.  The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time!",Curious to dive deeper
41," Yes you are right, I didn't know sharks didn't have ribs. I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters?",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah isn't that interesting.  I guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well.,Curious to dive deeper
41," every show played on TV, always wonder how dolphins kill sharks? I notice dolphins always attack from the side.",Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah I think you are right on that.  Dolphins are so interesting to me on how they communicate with each other.,Curious to dive deeper
41,Did you know sharks can be trained to bark like a dog?,Curious to dive deeper
41," Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ",Happy
42," Hello friend, Do you like horses?",Curious to dive deeper
42,I do. Did you know horses are able to sleep standing up and lying down?,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, that is cool. Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today? ",Curious to dive deeper
42,That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today.,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses.",Curious to dive deeper
42,I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating.,Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, I agree. There is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.",Curious to dive deeper
42,What do you think about sharks? Did you know they're sister species to rays?,Neutral
42," Yes, fascinating fact!. And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark.",Curious to dive deeper
42," I kinda feel bad for them. They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body.",Curious to dive deeper
42," Yes, sad indeed. Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees.",Curious to dive deeper
42,Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.,Curious to dive deeper
42," No, I've never seen it but I have heard about it.  Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors, but sharks too?",Curious to dive deeper
42,I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs.,Neutral
42,I agree. Do you do any online shopping on Amazon.com? Amazon sells almost everything from A to Z.,Curious to dive deeper
42,I do. Did you know Amazon started as an online bookstore?,Happy
42," Yes, and then they later diversified to sell video downloads, MP3 downloads, audiobooks downloads, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. Wow.",Curious to dive deeper
42,Have you read anything about Amazon's proposed second HQ?,Neutral
42," No, I did know that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years, though.",Curious to dive deeper
42,I did know. I don't really understand a lot of what Jeff Bezos does. That money could've been used better elsewhere.,Curious to dive deeper
42," That could be. Maybe, he makes up for it by keeping his employees healthy.  Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 minutes a day as part of their shift.  Nice chatting with you.",Curious to dive deeper
43,Hey! I've been reading a lot lately. Do you read any fiction or poetry?,Curious to dive deeper
43," Hi! Hm. I don't read much fiction or poetry, but I've been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime. Do you have any favorites? I've tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It's tough! It's an art form, that I just can't do!",Curious to dive deeper
43," I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa. ",Neutral
43," Oh it's fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I'd really like to read it, but I can't find anything more about it, as of yet.",Curious to dive deeper
43," That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. ",Neutral
43," Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It's been so long since I've heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure.",Surprised
43," Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn't he?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC's are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy.",Surprised
43," I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Haha! I'm slightly certain that soon, they will write poetry. Computers have come such a long way! I found something really interesting, in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water! I wonder what went wrong with that. Maybe electricity and water wasn't the best idea?",Curious to dive deeper
43," Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it ""a biohazard"". What in the world could that mean?",Neutral
43," Hm.. Yeah I know that smoking near them, just really clogs everything up, kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such, but bio-hazard? I'm interested to learn why that is. Kinda scary!",Fearful
43,Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what kind warranty that one has?!,Surprised
43," Haha! Woah! There's a thing called transhumanists I guess, and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks! I don't want to do that! One lifetime is okay by me. I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever! Yikes!",Fearful
43," I agree! What if people tried to read my mind's unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that's private!",Happy
43,Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you!,Fearful
43," How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM. ",Neutral
43,That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram!,Surprised
43," Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination. ",Neutral
43," Woah! In the 50's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we've come a long way from that hatefulness. But still we have a ways to go, before things are truly equal, really for all races.",Surprised
43," Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives. ",Happy
43,Oh absolutely! Really all art forms and most certainly the internet is going to bring humanity together on a much more even playing field. It was really nice talking with you!,Happy
44,Hello! Are you an Amazon Prime member?,Curious to dive deeper
44," Yes, I am and love it!  That two day delivery really comes in handy!!",Happy
44,It really does! Even Sunday delivery rocks especially since Amazon contracted with the USPS.,Happy
44," Yes, I think that was good for the USPS!  How would you like to have a building named after yourself for being a customer and only spend $27.95?",Curious to dive deeper
44,If only I knew about it years ago!!!!! I didn't realize they own IMDB as well!,Surprised
44," I know, I didn't either!  Thinking the amazon warehouse workers don't need a gym membership with walking 7-15 miles each day on a shift! Omg!",Surprised
44,I would be the fittest man alive working there haha. They ought to use horses there! Especially Icelandic horses that can speedwalk!,Surprised
44," Ha, ha, ha, Yes!! Good idea, I love horses, Guess you can't ride your horses to school on, no vehicle day or you can get suspended.",Surprised
44,Oh I know I saw that two high school students did that! I remember kids would drive their tractors to my high school!,Curious to dive deeper
44," Oh really, Wow! Did you know Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses, after riding all those horses in the movies?",Surprised
44,You would have never guessed since he rode like hundreds of them! He should have rode sharks instead!,Surprised
44," Well, I guess sharks have been around a long time. Makes sense they were here before the trees and dinosaurs!!",Neutral
44,Crazy to think that is one long time! I didn't know they could be trained like dogs to bark!,Surprised
44,I didn't know that either. I would like to hear that. I will have to look that up!,Surprised
44,They already sound a lot smarter than me haha. I always wondered why dalmatians were used at firehouses.,Surprised
44," I know, isn't it good they helped calm and protect the  horses back then. Aren't Lipizzaner horses beautiful!!",Curious to dive deeper
44,Yes I think it was! It all makes sense to me now haha. They really are. I don't know many animals or things that can change colors of their skin!,Surprised
44," Yes it only takes about 6 years, and give great classical dressage performances!",Happy
44,I would love to see them in real life! I'm good with sharks though although I just snorkeled with some last month!,Curious to dive deeper
44," Really, very cool! I love to snorkel too! The coral reefs are so spectacular!!",Happy
44,They really are! Well it was nice chatting with you have a good night!,Surprised
45," Hey there, heard anything interesting lately? I sure have, did you know Amazon contributed 38 billion to the city of Seattle's economy just by being there? ",Curious to dive deeper
45," Hi, no I did not know. It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters!",Curious to dive deeper
45," That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in. ",Fearful
45,They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer,Happy
45," I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York!",Curious to dive deeper
45," Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft",Happy
45," Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world! ",Happy
45," An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much!",Curious to dive deeper
45,It's probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift.,Happy
45,that is a lot!,Happy
45," And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so!",Surprised
45,We can't deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!!,Happy
45," Me neither! Amazon seems to have a lot of power, they have a contract with the post-office to make sure our packages get delivered even on Sunday!",Surprised
45,that is neat. Did you know they started with being an online bookstore?,Surprised
45," That's incredible, they also have a publishing arm known as Amazon publishing for people who want to publish their eBooks through them!",Curious to dive deeper
45," that is good! Hey, do you like animals?",Happy
45," I love animals, my favorite is the Shark. Did you know they can be trained just like dogs? Talk about man's best friend.",Curious to dive deeper
45," Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named ""white Shark cafe"". I love coffee but I would try not to end up there!",Happy
45," Crazy, but what's even crazier is that Shark's have no rib cages! If they were on land they'd be crushed by the weight of their own body. ",Sad
45," We are all afraid and even terrified of sharks, but it looks like they can rescue sailors!",Happy
45," That's probably because they evolved earlier than Dinosaurs, nature's perfect killer!",Curious to dive deeper
45,Crazy! there a very small ones. there is one called small dwarf lantershark. and it has a lenght of 17 cms. well it was so nice talking to you!!,Happy
46,Good morning.,Neutral
46,good morning,Neutral
46,Do you keep up with the election?,Curious to dive deeper
46," yeah, but moderately.  You?",Neutral
46," yes, about the same. I know there are the republican and democrat party.",Neutral
46,the only election that I follow is the Presidential Election,Neutral
46,Same here. I don't follow local as I do not live in the same state more than 3 years at a time.,Neutral
46,I see. Do you know who has a higher authority than a state's governor?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think state senator. DId you know there hasn't been a president that wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853,Curious to dive deeper
46,Very interesting.  Was this President an independence in your opinion?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think so. I dont know if any green party have ever been elected. Did you know all presidents with beards have been republican.?,Curious to dive deeper
46,Just know about this fact by now.  Which party do you think will win the next Presidential Electin?,Curious to dive deeper
46,I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time?,Curious to dive deeper
46," I believe the current Texas's governor, but I do not remember his name",Neutral
46,Ancient Athens did their appointment by lottery instead of election.,Neutral
46," It is weird, but true",Surprised
46," The Beatles song ""come together"" was written for a California governor.",Neutral
46,There somehow was a connection between Beatles band and California politics.,Curious to dive deeper
46,Did you know North Dakotas governor declared martial law in 1934 and seceded from the U.S,Neutral
46," I did not know about this fact.  I am wondering if it is still in effect.  By the way, nice chatting with you",Surprised
46,You too. I do not think its in effect though.,Neutral
47,hi are you a republican?,Curious to dive deeper
47,No I am not. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
47," No I am not, I am a Libertarian. Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome.",Curious to dive deeper
47," I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election",Curious to dive deeper
47," I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years!",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN!",Curious to dive deeper
47," If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, and he would take Trump down.",Curious to dive deeper
47," I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years.",Sad
47," Right, I figured the same thing! I don't think he's good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged.",Curious to dive deeper
47," Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn't even have won the first time.",Surprised
47,For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system,Curious to dive deeper
47," Yep and nothing is being done about it. Bill Clinton cheated on his wife and every one through a fit and started impeachment proceedings, but Trump supposedly gets away with treason and it really grinds my gears.",Curious to dive deeper
47," For sure, and cheating on his wife a bunch of times!",Curious to dive deeper
47," yeah Clinton was not a good husband but he was a pretty darn good president, I will never understand why his personal life mattered to so many people, and then when it looks like we have an actual traitor in the seat no one seems to care.",Curious to dive deeper
47," for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you!",Surprised
47," Yeah same to you, good chat.",Curious to dive deeper
47,bye!,Curious to dive deeper
48," Hello, do you follow politics much?",Curious to dive deeper
48," Hi I do from time to time, it is hard to escape them all together. Did you know every republican president has had a beard? ",Curious to dive deeper
48,Oh pretty cool fact. And since 1853 the president has been either a republican or a democrat,Curious to dive deeper
48," Wow pretty dominant. THey did not start using the colors red and blue until 2000, I thought it was earlier than that",Curious to dive deeper
48," Yeah it does feel late, you are right. Did you hear about Truman and his refusal to take a photo on the dumbo ride?",Curious to dive deeper
48," Yeah he just id not want to be associated with Republicans in any way, shape or form and the dumbo is their logo",Curious to dive deeper
48,Yup pretty much. DO you know how officials were elected in ancient athens?,Curious to dive deeper
48," Yes by lottery, and I wonder how that would work nowadays probably a mess",Curious to dive deeper
48," Hahah agreed. In Nevada you have the options to not vote for any of the candidates, I like that",Curious to dive deeper
48," Me too, I wish it were in all the states. Too bad not a lot of people show up at the polls though",Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah I hope we can go past that almost 63%. We need to all vote,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yes I agree. Since 1990 it seems the taller candidate has been winning the election. Coincidence?,Curious to dive deeper
48,Hmm interesting one. DO you know what the Beatles song Come together was written for?,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah it was for the California governor Timothy Leary in 1969,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yeah that one. When Schwarzenegger was governor of California he did not live in Sacramento and commuted ever day,Curious to dive deeper
48," But he did not have it rough, he travelled by private jet 3 hours each day",Curious to dive deeper
48,Good for him I guess. North Dakota governor declared martial law in 1934,Curious to dive deeper
48,Yes and then seceded from the US. WOw,Curious to dive deeper
48," In Texas, the first female governor was elected before other stated had ratified the amendment",Curious to dive deeper
48," Nice, seems they were a bit more ahead of time/. Ralph Lawrence  Carr was the only governor that did not agree with the internment of japane americans during WWII",Curious to dive deeper
48,Must have been tough being the only guy.,Happy
49,The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?,Curious to dive deeper
49,Unfortunately yes.  It is not like the republican party of old times.,Neutral
49," Yeah a lot of things have changed, funny anecdote with Truman and Dumbo though",Curious to dive deeper
49,That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead.,Neutral
49," I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either,",Happy
49,Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know.,Neutral
49," So the red and blue colors, seem like they have been around forever but its a recent thing from the year 2000",Curious to dive deeper
49,That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember.,Neutral
49," It sure seems like a lot longer, so elections are really important Im just glad we have that choice many countries dont",Curious to dive deeper
49," Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63%",Neutral
49," And thats how we end up with leaders like Trump lol, also the taller candidate wins 75% of the time, interesting stat",Curious to dive deeper
49,So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol,Neutral
49," We sure do lol, did you know Nevada is the only state with the option ''None of these''",Curious to dive deeper
49,They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now.,Neutral
49," They do, seems like the best option at times lol",Curious to dive deeper
49,It really does.,Neutral
49,I think one of the best governors is Schwarzenegger would be cool to have the terminator as president one day,Curious to dive deeper
49,It really would1,Neutral
49," He is a great actor but also a great politician, he has done a lot for California and is a really popular guy",Curious to dive deeper
49," He really has.  Did you know he commuted by private jet each day, 3 hours!",Neutral
49," Sounds like a really busy guy, anyways its time for lunch, its been great chatting with you but Im taking a break, thanks a lot",Curious to dive deeper
50,What did you think of the last couple elections?,Curious to dive deeper
50,I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote.,Neutral
50,That is a great point. I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years,Curious to dive deeper
50,the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot.,Neutral
50," I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how?",Curious to dive deeper
50,i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly.,Neutral
50,yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not,Curious to dive deeper
50," it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones.",Neutral
50,Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans?,Curious to dive deeper
50," well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now.",Neutral
50,Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right?,Curious to dive deeper
50," no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south. ",Neutral
50," Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2",Curious to dive deeper
50," yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna.",Neutral
50," for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can't believe schwarzenegger was governor",Curious to dive deeper
50," he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.",Neutral
50,He was the terminator! That is all he needed! lol,Curious to dive deeper
50," yeah, the governator. he was not a good speaker but people knew him. he didnt get much done because he didnt understand politics.",Neutral
50," For sure, I would have voted for him if I was in california, even though he ruined the state. ",Curious to dive deeper
50," people that should run government do not run for office. if they run for office, we probably dont want them in there.",Neutral
50,I agree with you. It was so nice chatting with you!,Curious to dive deeper
51,No. I think it's so interesting that the Republican Party is referred to as the Grand old party.,Curious to dive deeper
51,I agree.  I wonder why they gave themselves that moniker.,Curious to dive deeper
51,Yeah I'm not sure. But every US president with a beard has been Republican.,Surprised
51,True.  I also heard that Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans when she was in college.,Surprised
51,Oh that's interesting especially given the fact that she just ran Democrat. The red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000.,Surprised
51,That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.,Neutral
51,Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland.,Surprised
51,I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand.,Neutral
51,Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It's funny to think that ride has been around since 1957.,Neutral
51," It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL",Neutral
51,Haha thats funny. Apparently officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believe elections would lead to oligarchy.,Surprised
51,Well elections also lead to a dog being elected mayor... so I dont know what is worse.,Neutral
51,Haha yes good point. I hope that one day the voter turnout for presidential elections will breach 63%.,Curious to dive deeper
51,Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data.,Neutral
51,Yeah that is definitely an odd stat.,Surprised
51,There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy,Neutral
51," Haha i guess you can vote for anything. Like blinking, another odd stat is the tallest candidate has won in 75% of elections.",Surprised
51,So we need to look for a slow blinker and a tall person for 2020.,Curious to dive deeper
51," Yeah they will no doubt win! Nevada is actually the only state to have a ""none of these"" candidates voting option.",Surprised
51," That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates.",Neutral
51,Yea more states should do it maybe. More states should elect women too. Texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment!,Surprised
52,Do you follow politics?,Curious to dive deeper
52,I do. I just learned that the Republican Party was founded by anti-slavery activists. Surprising.,Surprised
52,I never knew that.  There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1853.,Happy
52,That's a good thing! Did you know in 1957 President Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the Republican Party?,Surprised
52,That's funny!  Consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats started in 2000.  Could have swore they used those colors before then.,Happy
52," Really? I thought so too! Did you know Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for Presidential elections?",Curious to dive deeper
52,I didn't know that.  Every US president with a beard has been a Republican.  Interesting.,Happy
52,Huh. I never noticed! Hard to believe voter turnout for US Presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.,Surprised
52,That's an amazing statistic.  Wow.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75 percent of the time.,Happy
52,Oh that is funny! During the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in 9 states.,Surprised
52,Interesting.  Do you ever vote for the governor in your state?  I do.,Happy
52," I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet.",Surprised
52,Didn't know that.  I bet that would get old though flying like that every day.,Curious to dive deeper
52,It is certainly a lot. Did you know the Beatles song Come Together was actually written for Tim Leary's 1969 CA Governor campaign.,Happy
52,I had no idea.  Wonder why a British band at the time would write a song for an American election?  Interesting.,Happy
52,Very! Did you know Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only Governor to oppose the internment of Japanese Americans during WW2?,Surprised
52,I didn't know that.  I've heard about when they did that though to those people.,Happy
52," It's something else, that's for sure.",Neutral
52,In 1934 I see that North Dakota's governor declared martial law and seceded from the US.  I'm learning all kinds of new things today.,Happy
52," Wow! Well, Texas elected their first female Governor, the second in the nation, before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. ",Surprised
52,Looks like Texas was ahead of the times!  Thanks for chatting!,Happy
53,Are you aware that the taller candidate for president has won 75% of the elections of them time.,Curious to dive deeper
53,Hello - it doesn't surprise me. I've even heard that taller people in interviews for jobs tend to get the job more often.,Surprised
53," Crazy, is that true? ",Curious to dive deeper
53," Not sure how true it is, but that's what I've been told. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college?",Surprised
53,I'm not surprised. Did you know Arnold traveled 3 hours a day to Sacramento when he was the governor?,Curious to dive deeper
53,Wow that's crazy. I can't imagine traveling that far for work.,Surprised
53,Me either. Did you know Tim Leary ran for governor of CA?,Curious to dive deeper
53," I did not know that, but that's interesting. I didn't know congress has played a democrat vs. republican baseball game every year since 1909. ",Curious to dive deeper
53," I did, it must be one boring game! ",Curious to dive deeper
53,Yea I bet it is a very boring game. A cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election once before.,Surprised
53,I can believe it. Did you know Nevada is the only stat that has a none of these candidates as a voting option?,Curious to dive deeper
53,Wow I didn't know that about Nevada.,Curious to dive deeper
53," Yeah, must be an interesting state to live in. Have you ever visited there? ",Curious to dive deeper
53,I have been to Las Vegas twice. What about you?,Neutral
53," Yeah, I've been. But I don't think a majority of the people that visit there vote. ",Curious to dive deeper
53," Yea, I'm not too sure on that. I saw that all elections conducted in Oregon are conducted by mail.",Curious to dive deeper
53," Interesting. It rains a lot in Oregon, have you ever visited? ",Curious to dive deeper
53," Never been to Oregon, but not a state I think I would want to live in with all of the rain they get. ",Neutral
53," Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of rainy states to be honest. ",Curious to dive deeper
53,Me either. Did you know the government of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool?,Curious to dive deeper
53," No, weird. Is a hew a professional swimmer? ",Curious to dive deeper
54,Do you watch many movies in the theaters?,Curious to dive deeper
54,Yes I love watching movies! Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until steven spielberg's jaws.,Surprised
54,Steven spielberg still makes millions from star wars off a bet with george lucas they made in 1977!,Surprised
54," haha thats awesome,  I wonder what the bet was.Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack. ",Surprised
54,I was wondering the same! After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout.,Surprised
54,Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop,Surprised
54," Too funny! Speaking of entertainers that make a lot of money, With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star.",Surprised
54,He is very talented. Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure.,Surprised
54," Good thing they didn't! Disney's ""treasure planet"" was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.",Surprised
54," yeah,  I read that recently,  I never saw it.  The movie trojan wars with a budget of $15,000,000 has earned only $309 in box office",Surprised
54,Yikes! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million.,Disgusted
54,That movie was great and creepy at the same time.,Surprised
54,Super creepy. Spielberg became a household name as the director of Jaws.,Surprised
54,Did you know that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed,Neutral
54,That's sad. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water.,Neutral
54," Also, When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.  Such short days!  i wouldnt mind going to work for only 2 hours lol ",Surprised
54," That would be great! If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.",Surprised
54," Mind blown!  I love these facts! In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they would ever make contact with earth",Surprised
54,What?! Thats funny. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.,Surprised
54,The earth is old!  Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century,Neutral
54," Wow. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. ",Surprised
54,was good talking to you!,Surprised
55,Did you ever watch ET?,Curious to dive deeper
55," Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid!",Happy
55,Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that?,Curious to dive deeper
55," No, I haven't see it.  Have you?",Curious to dive deeper
55," I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects.",Curious to dive deeper
55," Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I'm sure Spielberg appreciated it!",Surprised
55," Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates.",Happy
55," It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death!",Fearful
55," Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems. I can totally imagine this happening in the future.",Curious to dive deeper
55," OMG, goodness, alot of people would def get hooked on that! Do you watch alot of movies?",Curious to dive deeper
55,I don't really though I like Disney movies. How about you?,Surprised
55," Me too, I love Disney movies.  I read that Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty flopped.",Surprised
55,I didn't even know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop! Treasure Planet was also a Disney movie and was the most expensive box office flops of all times.,Surprised
55,I did know that Treasure Planet was a big time flop.  I can't remember anybody that saw it saying they liked it. I read that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star.,Happy
55,Would  you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.,Surprised
55," I remember seeing it, but it wasn't on Valentine's day!",Surprised
55,Trojan Wars on the other hand ws a failure. It had a 15 million budget and earned only $309 in box office.,Surprised
55,That's pitiful!,Surprised
55," Yes that is quite sad. Another sad thing is even though humans are destroying the earth, if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent one minute and 17 seconds.",Surprised
55," Awesome, I read somewhere that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5 1/2 hours.  ",Surprised
55," Wow, I can't even get enough done in 24 hours!",Surprised
56," Hi Turker, are you familiar with Steven Spielberg? ",Curious to dive deeper
56,Hey. Steven Spielberg is one of the most popular directors. Seen so many of his films.,Neutral
56," Yes you are right, have you seen E.T? if yes, did you like the movie, I know it's an old movie.",Curious to dive deeper
56," Yes it is an old movie. I like older movies. I remember when the game for the atari came out, they literally had to mass dump the product  in a field somewhere.",Neutral
56," Yes I heard about that, but I wonder if the atari could have been recycle, just to think about all those Items were destroyed.",Curious to dive deeper
56,Yeah. its funny that he made all these movies here for all humans to see. Here on planet earth. A 4.5 million year old rock. I wonder if aliens seen our movies?,Curious to dive deeper
56," yes you are right, I really like all the Jurassic Parks, I have watched those movies several times.",Curious to dive deeper
56," Dude!!! Tell me about it. Its crazy that Tom hanks made so much money. Making 8,5 billion worldwide and wasnt in any of the sagas. not in star wars and not in jurassic park.",Curious to dive deeper
56," Yes Tom Hanks made a lot of money also, did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in jaws?",Curious to dive deeper
56," That is so cool how invlolved he is. I read that a movie named trojan wars costed $15,000,000 to make and only made $309. I need to find out what movie that is lol",Curious to dive deeper
56," Wow what a loss, did you know Steven Spielberg still make millions from star wars because a bet from George Lucas in 1977?",Surprised
56,Yes I read that. I did not know that he Directed The Color Purple. Saving private ryan was one of my favorites though.,Neutral
56,Either me I just recently saw color purple and it still a good movie like  I have seen it for the first time.,Curious to dive deeper
56,You see how big Oprah is now right? She was wonderful in that movie.,Happy
56," Yes she was, do you usually purchase your tickets from the box office or purchase online?",Curious to dive deeper
56,I always buy it online. I try to avoid missing out on big titles like star wars. Pick it up at the theatre.,Curious to dive deeper
56,Did you know that more than 80 percent of the earth natural forests already been destroyed?,Curious to dive deeper
56," Yeah I read that. And we continue to use our resources like we dont have a clue whats going on. If global warming hits us, think of the already 71 % water covering earth. It will be catastrophic ",Curious to dive deeper
56," Yes you are right, we can't see it because most of the water is underneath us. ",Curious to dive deeper
56,Oooo imagine the animals in the unexplored water world we have not seen yet. 4.5 million years old and the world has animals in its oceans for quite some time now. Like the lizards.,Curious to dive deeper
56," when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night.",Curious to dive deeper
57,Did you know that summer was considered a bad time to release a movie?,Curious to dive deeper
57,In the past it may have been.,Curious to dive deeper
57," Yes, it was until Jaws was released. That was a scary movie back in the day.",Curious to dive deeper
57," Yeah, that was a good movie. Did you like it? ",Curious to dive deeper
57,I use to. I think I have seen it too many times now. Spielberg played the clarinet for the soundtrack.,Curious to dive deeper
57," Yeah, that is pretty interesting. Did you see the Goonies? ",Curious to dive deeper
57,I have. That is a cute movie. I love how they get the jewels at the end to pay the mortgage.,Curious to dive deeper
57,It is pretty good. I'm fairly certain Stranger Things is a rip off of it.,Curious to dive deeper
57,I've never seen that movie. There are so many rip-offs these days.,Curious to dive deeper
57,It is a show on Netflix actually. The first season isn't that bad.,Curious to dive deeper
57," I don't have Netflix. These days, I'm sure that sounds weird.",Neutral
57,I don't either. I saw it at a friends house.,Curious to dive deeper
57,I heard that Netflix is losing a lot of money because of password sharing. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star? I would believe it.,Surprised
57," Yeah, that could be, they are creating a lot of their own content. ",Curious to dive deeper
57,All the streaming channels seem to be doing that now.,Neutral
57," Yeah, that is pretty cool. Do you use Roku? ",Curious to dive deeper
57," Yes, I love my ROKU.",Happy
57,Do you recommend getting one of them?,Curious to dive deeper
57," I would definitely. You can also get Netflick, Hulu. I have Amazon Prime which has lots of channels.",Happy
57,Oh cool. Then maybe I will check that out. Are you a Tom Hanks fan?,Curious to dive deeper
57,I truly am. I draw charcoal portraits and I have drawn a picture of him. He is an amazing actor. I also like Robin Williams. I noticed he did a lot of movies about dying.,Neutral
57," I think he is a great actor. Well, nice chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
57,Nice chatting with you too.,Neutral
58,Do you know much about the Bible?,Curious to dive deeper
58,some yes,Curious to dive deeper
58,Did you know that has sold over an estimated 5 billion copies?  Wow.,Happy
58,I knew it was perhaps the most sold and published book of all time,Curious to dive deeper
58,Yes. Prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary eduction!,Happy
58,Yes I lived in the Southern US for a while and they still use that at times,Curious to dive deeper
58," Nice.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  He used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection.",Happy
58," I was fascinated to hear about that.  That would mean he did not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, but that He was only a human man.",Surprised
58,Yes!  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only 2 US presidents that did not use a bible when they were sworn in.,Happy
58,Yes that would indicate to me that they were agnostics or aherents to another form of religion,Curious to dive deeper
58," Yes.  The biblical tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq.",Happy
58," I did not now that, but it is certainly possible.  William Shakespeare wrote an incredible amount of material even though he died at 49 years old.",Neutral
58,Yes he did!  he is regarded ad the greatest writer in the English language!,Happy
58," I think I read the cliff notes to one of his plays, but I could never stay interested in his works!",Curious to dive deeper
58," I read the cliff notes of some of his things in college.  He coined a lot of popular phrases that we still use today like ""good riddance"" and ""wild goose chase"".",Happy
58,Yes those sayings certainly seemed to have stuck into modern language,Curious to dive deeper
58,Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.  Interesting facts.,Happy
58,I guess that would mean Lewis and Clark were exploring the Western United States while Shakespeare was performing plays in England!,Curious to dive deeper
58," Yes!  lol  Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.  I never knew that.",Happy
58," Yes, true.  His works can be found in a library, which in Greek language means ""book+shelf"".",Curious to dive deeper
58,I love going to libraries!  I'm a heavy user of them.  It's been fun chatting with you!,Happy
58,Same thing to you. Good day.,Happy
58,You have a good day too!,Happy
59,There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don't you think?,Surprised
59," That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card?",Curious to dive deeper
59," I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought.",Surprised
59," I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time.",Surprised
59,That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books.,Happy
59," Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone?",Curious to dive deeper
59," I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?",Happy
59,The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85!,Surprised
59," Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?""",Neutral
59," Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare.",Surprised
59," I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays!",Happy
59," Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back!",Surprised
59,That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don't work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare's voice?,Curious to dive deeper
59,That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare's style and language in other languages.,Curious to dive deeper
59,That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school. I bet people use to study Shakespeare in school more than they do now. I hear that people often studied the Bible in school before 1963.,Curious to dive deeper
59," Yes, the Bible does still play a large role in our lives though. Presidents are still sworn in with them. I wonder why Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use Bibles at their swearing in ceremonies.",Curious to dive deeper
59," That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq.",Neutral
59,Thomas Jefferson didn't seem to agree with all parts of the Bible. He made his own version and cut out the supernatural parts. I wonder why that was.,Surprised
59," Interesting!. All so at least three Presidents saw the Bible differently (Jefferson, Roosevelt and Adams.) Iti is interesting to think about how the Bible changes too. For example, the apple from Adam and Eve was a translation from the 4th century.",Surprised
59,That's true. And different Bible canons have evolved over the century with overlapping contents but also diverging contents.,Curious to dive deeper
59," Yes. In fact, the what is seen as canonical depends on the traditions of different groups.",Neutral
59,That is what cuases disagreement between CHristian denominations about what should be included in the canon.,Curious to dive deeper
60,Hi!  How much do you know about planets?,Curious to dive deeper
60," Hello - I know the alternate names for Earth are gaia, tellus, and telluris.",Neutral
60," That is awesome, I wonder why they settled on Earth.  It is the only one without a God/Goddess name.",Neutral
60,I saw that in 1975 the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus.,Surprised
60," Wow, maybe that is how they found out it doesnt tilt/",Neutral
60,You can fit every other planet between Earth and the moon/,Surprised
60," Wow, I didnt realize it was really that far away.  Does that include pluto, they can't decide about that poor planet.",Curious to dive deeper
60,I believe it does. There is a planet that orbits four stars.,Surprised
60,There is a planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree F weather.  No thanks.,Curious to dive deeper
60,That's crazy! Manned space stations orbit Jupiter are impossible due to the intense radiation.,Surprised
60,I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter.,Neutral
60,I've heard that too. Even heard you can pick up the strong storms on Earth over radios,Surprised
60,Jupiter has a moon that could be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.,Neutral
60,Wow that's crazy. Do you know much about governors?,Curious to dive deeper
60," Some, I know Schwarzenegger never lived in Sacramento, he commuted daily by private jet.",Neutral
60,That would be hard to do. It says he went 3 hours per day by private jet. Talk about a long commute.,Surprised
60,i couldnt do that.  time is too valuable.,Neutral
60,I agree. Did you know that Athiests cannot be governor of South Carolina.,Surprised
60," Wow, I didnt know that.  Texas actually elected the first female governor.",Surprised
60,That's really good to know. The governor of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool.,Surprised
60,Nice chat!  Have a great day!,Neutral
61,hello do you like dance?,Curious to dive deeper
61,I love it. Did you know Bruce Lee was a dancer too?,Curious to dive deeper
61,Yes pretty awesome he even won a cha -cha championship once,Curious to dive deeper
61," Yes, same with Tupac, he was a ballet dancer too",Curious to dive deeper
61," Yeah and he even was part of a nutcracker production, he was the mouse",Curious to dive deeper
61," Nice. Ballet dancers go through tons of shoes, 4 pairs a week",Curious to dive deeper
61,Yeah must cost a lot too. Babies are good at dancing too when they hear music,Curious to dive deeper
61," Yeah and they smile more once they hit the beat, smart",Curious to dive deeper
61,Yes super sweet. Jackson had a patent on a device that improved his dance moves,Curious to dive deeper
61,Nice. Do you like soundtracks?,Curious to dive deeper
61," Yes I do. Did you know Spielberg, when creating the soundtrack for Jaws, played the clarinet?",Curious to dive deeper
61,the Brother Where Art Thou one is 8 times certified platinum,Curious to dive deeper
61,Wow! That is impressive. Phil Collins speaks many languages and recorded the Tarzan ST in all of them.,Curious to dive deeper
61," Yes including german, spanish, italian, and french. Amazing",Curious to dive deeper
61,I know. The track title in the Batman Begins ST is named after a genius of a bat,Curious to dive deeper
61,Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews?,Curious to dive deeper
61," I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you?",Curious to dive deeper
61,Me too. Did you know Bay's average rating for his movies is just 38% there?,Curious to dive deeper
61,Wow that low? Movies based on video games also have a low rating there too,Curious to dive deeper
61,Yeah it seems. It is owned by Warner Bros,Curious to dive deeper
61,Yeah they seem to have their hand on everything,Curious to dive deeper
62,Are you a fan of dance?,Curious to dive deeper
62,Sure. I find the movement very aesthetically pleasing.,Neutral
62,They say that babies spontaneously dance to music. I suppose that shows there's something very fundamentally human in dance.,Surprised
62,Not just human! Parrots are able to dance perfectly to music. They speculate it's tied into their ability to mimic.,Neutral
62," Wow, I guess everything with a heartbeat probably feels some impulse to dance. More advanced forms of dance have aesthetic and symbolic value. ",Curious to dive deeper
62,Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones?,Neutral
62," LOL, no. Can't imagine how that would help her get the part? I do know that Bruce Lee once won a cha-cha competition in Hong Kong.",Surprised
62," That's pretty funny. Apparently, Mr. Rogers learned to breakdance on an episode.",Neutral
62,And rapper Tupac Shakur danced in the Nutcracker in high school. Sounds like he and Mr Rogers swapped paths along the way.,Happy
62," Haha. Like Bill Bailey, an old tap dancer and Michael Jackson! Bill Bailey was first recorded moonwalking in 1955.",Neutral
62,So someone was moonwalking for anyone (literally) moon walked?,Neutral
62,Ha! That's a funny way to put it. I wonder what the called it back then? Maybe if he had been wearing those ballet slippers that make drawings from the movements we could come up with a better name.,Neutral
62,I hear they go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Lots of wear.,Curious to dive deeper
62," Soundtracks are important in dance, as well as movies, too.",Neutral
62," Yep. And some become bigger hits than the movies, such as the soundtrack to ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?"". It went octuple platinum.",Neutral
62,Alicia Keys wrote a song for the Men in Black soundtrack when she was only 16!,Neutral
62," That's impressive, although I haven't heard the tune. I know that Channing Tatum got his start dancing in Step Up when he was young. Met his wife that way.",Neutral
62," Yeah, it's too bad about their divorce.",Neutral
62," It appears to have been amicable, which is nice. They still describe each other as best friends.",Neutral
62,Step Up had a really fun soundtrack.,Neutral
62,But I think the critics hated it. I think it has 19% approval at Rotten Tomatoes.,Neutral
62," Rotten Tomatoes has some pretty high standards, though. Neither Ashton Kutcher or Jennifer Love Hewitt have been in movies with a ""Fresh"" rating.",Neutral
63,Good evening!  Do you know much about Maryland's governor?,Curious to dive deeper
63," Not too much,  so you?  Did you know that ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internement of japanese americans during ww2?",Curious to dive deeper
63," I didn't know that.  Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change.",Neutral
63," Thats interesting.  the beatles song""come together"" was written for 1969 governor campaign.",Curious to dive deeper
63," Larry Hogan could probably have used the support of a group like the Beatles, but I'm sure he will be ok.  At least he isn't as bad as North Dakota's in 1934 who actually seceded from the US for a short time!",Surprised
63,when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol,Neutral
63," Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say ""I'll be back!""  ",Happy
63,haha good one!,Curious to dive deeper
63,Did you hear that Texas had a female governor before other states even allowed women to vote?,Curious to dive deeper
63,Yeah thats really interesting. did you know there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853?,Curious to dive deeper
63," Wow!  We truly are a two party system, but don't try getting elected as president as a democrat with a beard.  So far all bearded presidents have been republican.",Happy
63," Im not excited about that,  I will never be president lol ",Curious to dive deeper
63,It's crazy to think that red/blue connotations for the parties isn't even 20 years old.,Surprised
63," Yeah it seems like that was always the case,  but I guess not.  ",Neutral
63," The Bush's had a heck of a run with three terms.  In fact, before Trump, you'd have to go back to 1928 to find an elected republican that didn't have nixon or a bush.",Surprised
63," Thats interesting,  do you know much about our planets?  The planet uranus rotates sideways instead of spinning. ",Curious to dive deeper
63,Crazy!  Jupiter is so big that it has moons that would be planets if they simply orbited the sun and Jupiter.,Neutral
63,That is cool.  there is a planet that shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph!!!  thats insane!,Curious to dive deeper
63,Wow.  There are some crazy planets out there.  Venus doesn't even have seasons because it doesn't tilt and rotates in a different direction than the rest of the planets that revolve around our sun.,Surprised
63," That is really interesting. I heard that astronauts can vote from space, lol. ",Curious to dive deeper
63,Must have been an absentee ballot!,Neutral
63," It's been fun chatting,  have a good one. ",Neutral
64,Have you ever used the Rotten Tomatoes website? I check out all the movies I'm going to watch on there first.,Curious to dive deeper
64," You know, I do to.  I feel it's better to be informed than waste my time or money without knowing.",Neutral
64,If I'm watching a movie at home I don't care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater.,Happy
64," Amen, to that.  Movie ticket prices are outrageous, nowadays.  Netflix has almost 150 movies that carry a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating.",Surprised
64," I've found it has been so hard to find a movie on Netflix, I have been watching a lot of their original content lately though. Do you watch Netflix?",Curious to dive deeper
64,All the time.  It is another one of those companies created by college students.  Lol.  All I did in college was party!,Surprised
64," Yeah I didn't spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though.",Neutral
64," Just a random note, did you realize that Bruce Lee wa such a good dancer?",Surprised
64," I did not, but with his athleticism and talent I am not surprised.",Happy
64,I know right!  He won the 1958 Cha Cha championship in Hong Kong.  I can not even picture that.,Surprised
64,I would like to see some video of that. I have only seen a couple of his movies.,Curious to dive deeper
64," Speaking of dancing, are you aware that Michael Jackson holds a patent on a dance device?",Surprised
64,I did not know that but if anyone would have one it's him.,Surprised
64," That's right, he was a master of dance.  This device apparently, helped him get that extreme lean that he did in some of his dances.",Neutral
64,Now that you mention it I do somewhat remember seeing how he did that. It was almost like a piece of metal that would lock into his shoe so he could almost lean 45 degrees. I believe he used it in the Smooth Criminal music video.,Happy
64," Looked very cool, when he did it!  I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet.  Have you heard anything about that?",Curious to dive deeper
64,I had heard he trained in the ballet. Did you know that the Air Jordan logo is him doing a ballet move?,Curious to dive deeper
64," Wow, I didn't know that!",Surprised
64,A lot of athletes have used ballet and now yoga to help with flexibility and reduce injuries!,Happy
64," Yes, I hear it does help tremendously.",Happy
64," I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!",Happy
65,hello,Neutral
65," Hello, Michael jackson has a patent. on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves",Happy
65,That is extremely interesting actually. never knew that,Neutral
65,I didn't either.  I guess for the song Smooth Criminal.,Surprised
65,perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting?,Neutral
65,Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker.,Sad
65,I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people,Happy
65," Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting. ",Happy
65," Dance truly is interesting. As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same",Surprised
65,Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.,Surprised
65,That I certainly didn't know. She is still too little for ballet lol,Neutral
65,Michael bay's average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38%,Happy
65,Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes,Happy
65,I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix.,Surprised
65,I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high,Happy
65," Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises.",Sad
65,true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that?,Happy
65,I didn't realize that Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack.,Sad
65,Same here. Thought it was very interesting,Happy
65," No doubt.  The soundtrack to 'o brother, where art thou?' is certified 8 times platinum.",Curious to dive deeper
65,yep.pretty fascinating,Neutral
65,Thanks for the chat.  It was informative.,Neutral
65,same. have a good day,Happy
65," Thanks, you too.",Neutral
65,bye,Happy
66,How do you like planet earth?,Curious to dive deeper
66,I find the earth and the solar system very interesting!,Curious to dive deeper
66,It is so interesting! I love learning about planets. Like Jupiters mon Ganymede!,Curious to dive deeper
66," Yes, I agree! Isn't the Ganymede Jupiters own moon?",Curious to dive deeper
66," yea, it would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun, that is amazing",Curious to dive deeper
66," Very, Did you know our planet Earth has other names besides Gaia?",Curious to dive deeper
66," I didn't know there were any names besides Earth, lol. I guess maybe the blue planet, what other names do you know?",Curious to dive deeper
66,Tellus and Telluris!  very cool! This is also a planet that orbits four stars!,Surprised
66,wow! I love learning! I think I saw once that astronomers found a planet many light years away that could sustain life,Curious to dive deeper
66," Yes, I heard that too! Exciting!! Do you know anything about the solar asteroid belt?",Curious to dive deeper
66," I do not know too much, i just know there is crazy things that happen out there, how about you?",Curious to dive deeper
66," True,  its has celestial bodies called Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta!",Curious to dive deeper
66," I need to tough up on my planet facts, you have so many! I know that five planets are visual with the naked eye in the sky",Curious to dive deeper
66," Yes, Aren't they interesting! Do you have a favorite planet? I think mine would be Jupiter and Venus!!",Curious to dive deeper
66," Mine is mars, I hope we get a man on mars in my lifetime, do you think it will happen/",Curious to dive deeper
66," Oh yes, Mars!! I love it too!! I hope so, There is a good chance we will. ",Happy
66," I bet, the more money we spend the better our chances. We just need some brave souls that are willing to take the chance like the first time we went to space!",Curious to dive deeper
66," Yes, very brave!! I hope we can do that sometime soon. Are there signs of water on Mars?",Curious to dive deeper
66,I think there have been theories of underground lakes and the potential of water. I will read up on it more. It was so nice chatting with you and getting good facts!,Curious to dive deeper
66," Really, I thought there was or at least they thought so!! Yes, enjoyed chatting too!",Curious to dive deeper
66,Have a great night!,Curious to dive deeper
67,Hi.  I guess Channig Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are getting a divorce.  Sad.,Sad
67," Yes, I read about that in the news. The things he says about it almost sound too good to be true...maybe it's sarcastic?",Curious to dive deeper
67," Not sure... They were a good team.  I guess ""Step Up"" was a favorite for many.",Neutral
67," Seems like it. I never saw it, though.They are pretty talented to be good at both acting and dancing. Singing, too?",Surprised
67," I think so, the ""Step Up"" soundtrack had high acclaim. ",Curious to dive deeper
67,I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.,Happy
67,That's refreshing... I can see why ABC Family was mentioned.,Happy
67," Kids love to dance to soundtracks, too. I think they even have a few video games with dance and music",Curious to dive deeper
67," Yes, they do.  I didn't know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer.  I thought he just beat up bad guys. ",Surprised
67,That's really cool! I think Patrick Swayze was also a multi-talented actor dancer. He was in a very famous movie and that soundtrack is also great.,Curious to dive deeper
67,I can see him but Tupac?  I guess Tupac danced ballet in high school.  How can you hide a gun in tights?,Surprised
67,That sounds so crazy it might even be an urban legend! Ballet dancers go through a lot of shoes in just one week. Think how their feet feel!,Curious to dive deeper
67,Ouch!  I guess we are all dancers to some degree.  Babies naturally dance when they hear music.,Happy
67," I remember as kids we'd have birthday parties and dance to various Disney Soundtracks. Do they still make those, I wonder?",Happy
67," If they do, they are probably ""R"" rated.  Disney has changed for the worse.  I think it's great the Spielberg played clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.",Surprised
67," Speilberg is amazing! It wouldn't surprise me if he could dance well, too! I wonder if he'd ever play an instrument in another soundtrack?",Curious to dive deeper
67," Don't know... I do know that Phil Collins recorded the Tarzan sound track in many different languages. Ilaian, German, etc. ",Surprised
67,That's amazing! I wonder if those are all rated on Rotten Tomatoes? It's owned by WB so I wonder if it's hard on Disney or other rivals?,Curious to dive deeper
67,I wonder if that biases their judgement for WB productions.  No film based on video games ever got a rating above 44% from RT.,Surprised
67," If you like video games, some of those movies are pretty good, too. I didn't realize Rotten Tomatoes was started by students until recently! Brilliant!, ",Happy
67,I kind of look at IMDB for ratings... Great chat! You were excellent!,Neutral
68," Hey do you like Star Wars? I know that I like the first three movies, the next three are ok, and I really hate the new ones",Curious to dive deeper
68," I love the original 3 like you. But the new ones are bad, I agree. ",Curious to dive deeper
68,Haha well I'm glad we agree on that. What did you think about Rogue one that came out in 2016? I thought it was a total disaster haha,Curious to dive deeper
68," I think any movie that relegates the Great Luke to the trash heap is nothing. ""No! I am your Father"" is the greatest scene of all time.",Curious to dive deeper
68," Oh I agree with you. I just feel bad that James Earl Jones only made about eight grand for doing the voice in the first movie, although it was only about two and a half hours of work, he hit it out of the park",Surprised
68,Really? That is bad. Have you ever scene the scenes without him and the original actor?,Surprised
68," Yes I have. Doesn't that guy have a Scottish accent or something? And I think he thought he was going to be the actual voice, very strange.",Happy
68,Hilarious. I think they are great though. I didn't know JEJ only spent 2.5 hours recording though!,Curious to dive deeper
68," Yeah I know, he did a great job for the limited time, can you believe that 20th Century Fox let George Lucas keep the merchandising rights, that's what made him a billionaire, so crazy I don't think they would do that ever again",Surprised
68," I think I can believe it. Good for him, what does the corporation need with something they didn't invent anyways?",Curious to dive deeper
68," No I agree with you. Are you going to watch the Academy Awards by the way? They give out 24 Awards and I think that the first broadcast was back in 1930, which is wild",Surprised
68," Yeah, so like the academy awards totally suck. Does anyone actually give a bleep what they think?",Curious to dive deeper
68," No I think that they don't really pick the best movies. A lot of good movies that I like a lot or never even nominated. I do like Daniel Day-Lewis though, I'm glad that he won three times for best actor",Happy
68," By the way, do you watch you tube? Much better than AA!",Curious to dive deeper
68,Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago,Surprised
68," Oh, I can believe it. Google could make it a success, Youtube couldn't succeed on it own. ",Curious to dive deeper
68," Yep I agree with you. Did you know that YouTube is the second biggest search engine, I assume that Google is the first",Surprised
68,I'm surprised it isn't the first to be honest!,Curious to dive deeper
68,Yeah I know that everyone uses YouTube do you ever watch the music video for Gangnam Style by the way. That is one of the highest viewed videos on youtube,Surprised
68," No, but I have watched it. Good song, good short term fad too!",Curious to dive deeper
68," Yep it was definitely a fad haha. So was Justin Bieber song Baby, I don't think it should be the most disliked video on YouTube, but it's definitely annoying",Surprised
69," Hello there, so have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?",Curious to dive deeper
69,I have seen several. I read Tran who played rose left Instagram after racist messages from fans.,Surprised
69," That is so sad fans are so cruel to people.  I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though. ",Curious to dive deeper
69,Me too. The last Jedi divided it's fans,Surprised
69,Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.  But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid.,Curious to dive deeper
69,Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last name to get in to US easier,Surprised
69," No I didn't know that, I wonder how many people do that when they come here.  ",Surprised
69,Seems like a lot. Apparently they get more call backs with American last names.,Surprised
69," Yeah I can see that, and whatever helps for them I'm sure they will do.  Hey do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid for doing all the darth vader lines? ",Curious to dive deeper
69,No. What is it?,Curious to dive deeper
69," I guess he only got paid $7,500, but when I say only, it only took him two and a half hours to do them!",Curious to dive deeper
69,That's a lot for 2 and half hours.in 2018 star wars was worth $65 billion,Surprised
69," Holy cow, I wonder how much it was worth in 1998, probably less than half of that. ",Curious to dive deeper
69," In 2013 star wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be in navajo",Surprised
69,That is awesome!  Did you know Star Wars holds a Guinness World Record title?,Curious to dive deeper
69,No for what? Fox thought star wars would flop,Surprised
69,I guess they hold the record for most successful film merchandising franchise.  When I hear merchandising I think of that scene from Spaceballs.,Curious to dive deeper
69,Do you watch the academy awards? Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio,Surprised
69,That is crazy!  I heard he has more than Johnny Depp and Will Smith as well.,Curious to dive deeper
69,The Oscars were nominated for 9 Emmys in 2013.,Surprised
69," What? That is so stupid to me, why an awards show?  Do you know who is the only actor to win best actor 3 times?",Curious to dive deeper
69,Daniel day Lewis I think.,Surprised
69," Good call!  He is a great actor though so I can see it, I wonder what roles he won for.  Maybe the butcher role in Gangs of New York. ",Curious to dive deeper
69,Probably. Blazing saddles was nomonanom for 3 Oscars too. Well have a great night.,Surprised
70," Hello, do you like Star Wars?",Curious to dive deeper
70,I don't really though I do respect it as a franchise. How about you?,Curious to dive deeper
70,Yeah I like it. Lucas' wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award,Curious to dive deeper
70," Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It's spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks.",Curious to dive deeper
70,Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo,Curious to dive deeper
70,Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision.,Surprised
70," Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now. James Earl Jones got only $7500 recording Darth Vader's lines",Curious to dive deeper
70,Crazy! Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop and agreed to George Lucas's proposition to forgo an extra $500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. Their decision cost them billions of dollars,Surprised
70,Yeah and at the same time made Lucas a billionaire. He just had a lot of confidence in his work,Curious to dive deeper
70," Yeah, in 2018 the whole Star Wars franchise was estimated at $65 billion",Surprised
70,That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards?,Curious to dive deeper
70," No, I don't. How about you?",Curious to dive deeper
70,I watch it sometimes. Did you know Daniel Day-Lewis has won the Oscar 3 times?,Curious to dive deeper
70,I am not sure I even know who he is. Good for him. John Williams has been nominated for more Oscars than anyone besides Walt Disney.,Surprised
70,Yeah Disney is going to be hard to reach by anyone else with 22 Oscars,Curious to dive deeper
70,He got a special Oscar in 1938 for snow white that had a regular sized statuette and seven miniature oscars.,Surprised
70,That is amazing. Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio and some other big names.,Curious to dive deeper
70," Speaking of Oscars, Kelly Marie Tran went to them. She is the first non white woman in Star Wars leading role.",Surprised
70,That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles?,Curious to dive deeper
70,I have not seen it. Tran faced a lot of racist and abusive language on her social media though. That's sad.,Sad
70,That is just sad. I hope we move towards behaving as we should with each other. Nice chat :),Happy
71,Hi there!  Are you a Star Wars fan?,Curious to dive deeper
71," Hi, Yes I am a star wars fan!!! Since I was a kid. What about you?",Happy
71,Yes!  Mostly when it comes to the Original trilogy.  Those are the best.,Neutral
71," It is amazing how star wars was created long time ago , in 1977 and with a movie made last year , the star wars fever is so alive!",Happy
71,It has to be one of the most sucessful franchises ever.  40 years and still has a great following.,Neutral
71," It is incredible that the first eight films were nominated for academy awards, they were able to  create wonderful productions!",Happy
71,The total value of the franchise was about $65 billion.  It will definitely always be a legend!,Surprised
71,And 20 century fox though star wars was going to be a failure!!,Surprised
71," I heard that, apparently so did Harrison Ford, I heard he didnt want to be credited in the film initially.",Neutral
71," Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire",Happy
71,It definitely did.  Do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid to record Darth Vader's lines?,Curious to dive deeper
71," I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so",Happy
71," Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame.",Neutral
71," I agree, it is basically nothing.. Did you know George Luca's wife influenced the star wars movies a lot?",Surprised
71," Yeah, didnt she receive an editing award too?",Curious to dive deeper
71,She got an award for editing!! I think she made an important contribution.. good job,Happy
71,She definitely changed some parts significantly.  It would have been far different without her.,Neutral
71," Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing!",Happy
71,Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!  That is hard to believe!,Neutral
71," Wow, and he has won more awards than Leo Di Caprio, Johnny Depp and Bill murray combined",Surprised
71," I didnt realized he had any at all, I wonder what they were all for.",Curious to dive deeper
71," Have to check!! Do you know who has won , best actor 3 times?",Surprised
71,Who?  Harrison Ford?,Neutral
71," It is Daniel Day Lewis, what an accomplishment",Surprised
71," It really is!  It has been great chatting, but I must go.  have a great night!",Neutral
71,You do the same!!,Happy
72,Government is fascinating. It seems so different the world over yet there are common threads in every type.,Curious to dive deeper
72," I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much.",Neutral
72,So true. I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president. A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions.,Curious to dive deeper
72,True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution?,Neutral
72,Australia's constitution is weird though. It doesn't protect the people as much like an american one does.,Curious to dive deeper
72,I did not know that. Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a title! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that.,Curious to dive deeper
72,With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents.,Neutral
72,Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff.,Neutral
72,Right? lol. I wonder if you can meet the cat if you tour the offices?,Curious to dive deeper
72,The cat doesn't take visitors without an appointment.,Neutral
72,I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other.,Neutral
72," When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200?",Neutral
72,That would be one way to cut the costs. How many people are turning 100 that it is costing enough to have to find a cheaper solution? Talk about a healthy society.,Curious to dive deeper
72," Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov't can't afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?",Neutral
72,I find him very interesting. He is one of those chameleon actors that you never watch and go Oh that's Johnny Depp he sort of absorbs the character.,Curious to dive deeper
72,Johnny  is producing and maybe starring in a biopic about  Dr. Seuss. I would be interested in that.,Neutral
72,I think he would make a fantastic Dr. Seuss Look what an amazing job he did with willy wonka. I think the creepy edge he gave to the character was perfect.,Neutral
72," He is really dedicated to his craft. Edward Scissorhands was an odd film, but he made it work.",Neutral
72,That whole movie was just weird. He might be a strange man but he seems to really have a good heart.,Neutral
72,I know that he often visits children in the hospital dressed up as a pirate.,Neutral
72,He seems to really be an animal lover too.,Happy
73," Many people like to watch horror films, I don't like slashers but like some like World War Z, did you know the horror film genre has been around for more than a century?",Curious to dive deeper
73," oh yes, I even watched the first ""Nosferatu"" movie - not sure when that was made but it's quite old...",Happy
73," That one is a  classic, based on the book by Bram Stoker.  They say if you watch a horror movie you will enjoy abstract art more, maybe because they are both a horror?",Happy
73,I always loved horror movies... they work good on Your imagination ;),Curious to dive deeper
73," They are good for your health as well, guess why?",Curious to dive deeper
73,Horrors good for Your health ? You poop more often ? I don't know ;),Surprised
73," Ha, that or have a heart attack, no seriously, you burn 180 calories watching a horror movie, wonder what other types of cinema burn?",Curious to dive deeper
73," I mean if the movie really scares You, than maybe, but what if You just like the story, but it's no longer scary for You, because You've seen it all ? ;)",Curious to dive deeper
73," I can't imagine not being scared watching a horror movie, thats why I like other forms of cinema.  Do you know cinematogrrpahy is the science of motion picture photography and important to all types of movies?",Curious to dive deeper
73," well sure, it's just hundreds of pictures with sound in the background ;)",Curious to dive deeper
73," The art is making them look good with the right music and sound to tell a story.  Do youknow the guy who pioneered the use of the wide angle lens won aan oscar but was not a citizen until '43 and illegally married a white woman because he was Chinese American, we have done some stupid things in our past treatment of others.",Curious to dive deeper
73," I mean I wouldn't say it's stupid... if he was here illegally, that means he broke the law... there was no legal way to get here ?",Surprised
73," He was her and became a citizen, the law he broke was marrying a white woman because he was asian. That is crazy.",Happy
73," ahhh, I did not get that. So he came it legally ? and he couldn't marry white woman ? Was that a law ? What year was that ??",Surprised
73," His marriage did not become legal until 1948, prior to that it was considered illegal.  No woman has every been nominated for best cinematography Oscars either, so I guess there are still some issues.",Surprised
73,There will always be issues with race... but we're getting there...,Curious to dive deeper
73,I like the fantasy escape from all of our problems we find at the box office.  I guess others do to since Tom Hanks has made over 8.5 billion.,Surprised
73," I mean good for him, he was always very talented, but honestly, I don't remember seeing any new movie with him, do You ?",Surprised
73," I haven't seen anything new in a long time,  I did love Forest Gump, and You've got Mail though.  I really like Disney movies, do you know Sleeping Beauty was such a failure they considered closing down.",Happy
73," lol, no I didn't know that. I have a beef with Disney thou... I loved it when I was a kid, but since they've destroyed Star Wars... they're dead to me ;)",Sad
73," I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70's.  Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money.",Curious to dive deeper
73," yes. just because its Disney and it has to be ok for kids ? make a division for adults and start making decent movies... You have the budget, technicians... nothing would stop them...",Curious to dive deeper
73,I think they have a separate division but can't remember what it is called.  I'm not sure I'd like to see the name Disney on a film like Silence of the Lambs though.,Surprised
73,Why not... it was a great movie. Classic. but I see what You 're saying. No I mean make movies like Star Wars for a little bit mature audience... don't focus on 6year olds because there are millions of 60 year old wanted to see how the story continues...,Curious to dive deeper
73,We never get to see the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han's son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do.,Happy
73,it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either...,Curious to dive deeper
73," They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke",Sad
73," That's my point exactly ! He was Vader's son ! Son of a person born out of force.. in my mind, he should be leading everybody to defeat Siths OR maybe share the faith of his father and go the the dark side... but not this...",Curious to dive deeper
73," It was so frustrating and annoying.  Vader's turn to the bright side at the end should have affirmed him and gave him deterination to continue, and why have Han's son be so bad, that is just pointless,  I guess they couldn't think of a bad guy.",Disgusted
73,I think they are preparing a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it's in a bad taste. I personally think Han Solo lives ;),Happy
73," I won't even pay to see the rest of them,  the cinematography is great though.",Disgusted
73,Absolutely ;) no argument here ;),Happy
73," If I was a better cinematographer, I'd make my own movies, but thats not in the cards.  Its been nice visiting with you.",Happy
73," Same here, thank You so much for fun conversation ! ;)",Happy
74,Hey there what do you know about the prime minister of the UK?,Curious to dive deeper
74,I don't know that much actually. He has a cat though.,Curious to dive deeper
74,I love the name of the cat. The name is Chief Mouser of the cabinet office LOL can't say I like cats though haha,Surprised
74,Hilarious. What happens if someone is allergic?,Curious to dive deeper
74,I am actually allergic to cats. And that's a great question haha do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is?,Curious to dive deeper
74," yeah, she was in Fight Club, other than that I don't remember many of the movies with her. ",Curious to dive deeper
74,Apparently she's related to the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War I. That's very bizarre,Surprised
74,Really? That is pretty weird. Did you know if you hit 100 in japan they give you a silver cup?,Curious to dive deeper
74,I did not know that. It's funny that so many people turned 100 they had to find a way to make cheaper cups though haha,Surprised
74," Hilarious, at least they are healthy there. ",Curious to dive deeper
74,That's true they're definitely not giving those Awards away in the United States haha. I do like that Norway donated a billion dollars to save the Amazon rainforest though that's very nice of them,Happy
74," Yeah, that seems interesting, do they do a lot of business there? ",Curious to dive deeper
74,I'm not sure actually. They might have just donated it because they're nice. Unlike The guy who sold the Eiffel Tower twice who definitely just wanted the money haha,Surprised
74," That's hilarious, he wasn't even the owner. Did you know Johnny Depp directed the film brave? ",Curious to dive deeper
74,Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?,Curious to dive deeper
74," I haven't actually. LOL BTW, apparently 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US Government. ",Curious to dive deeper
74,Wow that is a lot. Very strange that Johnny Depp is making a movie about dr suess. But I think he would be great for the role,Curious to dive deeper
74," I think that may have already have been released, but maybe I am wrong. ",Curious to dive deeper
74,It does sound familiar. Have you seen the movie Edward Scissorhands? Apparently Johnny Depp only says about 200 words,Curious to dive deeper
74," It's been a very long time, but yeah I saw it. Now that I think about it, he barely speaks in that film! ",Curious to dive deeper
74,You're right. I do love that movie a lot though. It's a great winter movie. Johnny Depp seems like a nice guy. He adopted his one-eyed horse from the movie Sleepy Hollow when he heard it was going to be put down,Happy
75," hi, do you like johnny depp?",Curious to dive deeper
75," Hi, how are you? Who is Johnny Depp? A singer? An athlete?",Neutral
75," He is an actor. He is the one that directed the movie The Brave, if you have seen it",Curious to dive deeper
75,I have not seen it. Is it about brave people or an Indian brave? Is he an American Indian?,Neutral
75,I think he might be partly american indigenous. I am not sure though.,Curious to dive deeper
75,Is he pretty ethnic? I think he'd have to be pretty ethnic to pull that off. Not like Elvis. Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage?,Curious to dive deeper
75,He might be I am not sure. He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow,Curious to dive deeper
75,A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd. What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse? I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes.,Neutral
75,They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it,Curious to dive deeper
75," I guess he had a place for keeping horses. Do you know much about government? I am not a fan of government. It seems like a useful invention, much like a one-eyed horse.",Neutral
75,Me either but I do find it strange that the govnerment owns 86% of the land in Nevada,Curious to dive deeper
75,I figure the gov't must be up to something in that Nevada desert. War games? Alien spaceports?,Neutral
75,I have no idea they are certainly using it for something. Did you ever play nintendo?,Curious to dive deeper
75,I played a bit. I warn't into them games. I had other chores to attend to on the farm/prison where I growed up. You? Did you play them games?,Curious to dive deeper
75,Sounds rough. Do you know about wikileaks?,Curious to dive deeper
75," I applied for a job there, but they didn't hire me. Said my background wasn't suspicious enough. ",Neutral
75,Hahhaha that is funny. did you know they figured out the government is trying to destroy them,Curious to dive deeper
75," Well, they are Wikileaks, so they have a list of enemies pretty long. ",Neutral
75,Yes that makes sense. Did you know a man in france sold the eiffer tower twice?,Curious to dive deeper
75," That man could probably sell the govt's land in Nevada for us! Well, I've had a swell time chatting!",Neutral
75," Same here, have a good one.",Happy
76,Hi! Did you know the Prime Minister of Australia's position isn't actually in their constitution but only exists through custom? I find that surprising!,Surprised
76,Wow I didn't know that. I also didn't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did,Surprised
76," It's a little strange, isn't it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha!",Happy
76," That is very strange. Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? She was in the Harry Potter movies, but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister",Surprised
76," Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they're having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That's a good thing though!",Happy
76," That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way? Apparently the government try to destroy them, but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL",Happy
76," That's kind of ironic, isn't it? I wonder if Wikileaks will tell us what the government does with the 86% of Nevada's land that they own?",Curious to dive deeper
76," That is a good question. Maybe it is Area 51 that they own haha? It's also crazy to think that Norway donated a billion dollars to help save the rainforest, I wonder if they own the land or just donated it",Surprised
76,That's a good question. I'm glad they're taking action to protect the rainforests though! Did you ever hear about the guy in France who posed as a government official and sold the Eiffel Tower twice? It's like how did he pull that off? Someone like him could sell fire in hell! Ha!,Surprised
76,Haha yes a very talented salesman for sure! Definitely a scam too. What do you think about the actor Johnny Depp by the way? He likes to live in France,Curious to dive deeper
76,Does he really? I think he's a great actor. Although I'm not sure about his directing skills as I still haven't seen The Brave that he directed back in 1997!,Neutral
76," No I've never even heard of that movie. I do know that gives a good actor, I loved him in Edward Scissorhands even though he only said 196 words",Surprised
76,That is weird to have so few lines like that! I can't believe Gene Wilder didn't watch the Willy Wonka remake because he didn't want to be disappointed in Depp. That is a little disappointing to me.,Sad
76,Yes that is disappointing. I hope that Johnny Depp goes through with making a biopic about dr. Seuss. That would actually be my first choice for a person to play him,Happy
76," Agreed. That would be cool to see. I mean, I think that film would earn him another academy award nomination. I mean, He's already been nominated for three!",Neutral
76," Yes that is impressive! He seems like a nice guy, he adopted a one-eyed horse in one of his movies because they were going to put it down, that's nice thing to do",Happy
76," That's a very nice and humane thing to do! He's certainly come a long way since his rise in the 1980s with 21 Jump Street, hasn't he?",Happy
76," Yes absolutely! It's crazy that he was born in 1963, I remember when he was just a young man",Surprised
76,Absolutely! Back when he was just becoming a teen idol before going on to win Best Actor at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actor's Guild Awards!,Neutral
76,Yes absolutely! I never knew that he was actually named John Christopher Depp II though. I wonder if his dad was also an actor?,Curious to dive deeper
76," I wonder that as well now that you mention it! Hey, maybe one day he'll run for a position in the government! Ha! I'm sure he's wise enough to know each government has a constitution in place which as you know is a statement of its philosophies and principles! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a good evening, friend!",Neutral
77," How's it going, do you watch Horror films? The first ones were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley",Curious to dive deeper
77," I love horror movies, I am a stephen king fan!",Curious to dive deeper
77,It's kinda strange Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie,Surprised
77," Right, it must have made him so scared as a kid. I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later",Curious to dive deeper
77,I'm surprised the boy from the shinning couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins,Surprised
77," right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office",Curious to dive deeper
77," Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie",Surprised
77,Dang I need to watch like 10 per night for my diet since I don't do anything else lol,Curious to dive deeper
77,Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too,Neutral
77," I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it?",Curious to dive deeper
77," I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie",Neutral
77," I bet. You know what else is scary, Treasure Island by disney only made 309 dollars on a 15000000 dollar budget!",Curious to dive deeper
77," Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop",Neutral
77," sorry I meant treasure planet lol. Silence of the lambs came out on valentines day, imagine that date? lol",Curious to dive deeper
77,Well it couldn't of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office,Neutral
77," for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing",Curious to dive deeper
77," That is crazy. Do you like Tom Hanks, he's grossed over 8.5 billion at the box office",Curious to dive deeper
77," Man, he should be in every movie at that much money! Youre guaranteed to make money at that rate i think",Curious to dive deeper
77," Yea, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office draw",Neutral
77," That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
77,Have a good one,Neutral
78,Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?,Surprised
78," Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites.",Neutral
78,What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha.,Surprised
78," King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession.",Neutral
78,You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one?,Surprised
78," I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary.",Neutral
78,Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later.,Happy
78,I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was?,Neutral
78,That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one!,Surprised
78,I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him.,Neutral
78,That could be it! Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for best cinematography at the oscars?,Surprised
78," That is a shame. I don't know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more.",Neutral
78,I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!,Surprised
78," Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success. Stars, special FX, marketing. Doesn't matter.",Neutral
78," They really are, even with the big names. Tom Hanks has earned 8.5 billion in film earnings for his movies.",Happy
78,He is a bankable star. People love him. But he also works with certain people regularly. Spielberg. Zemeckis. They are capable directors.,Neutral
78,Oh for sure! Have you seen Disney's Treasure Planet? That was one of the most expensive box office flops ever.,Surprised
78,I did not. Was that animated? Usually animated stuff is pretty good. I'm surprised.,Neutral
78," I am surprised too, especially with the Disney name attached to it!",Surprised
78,I guess a lot depends on the director. I don't know who directed Treasure Planet.,Neutral
78,I am going to google that now. Have a good day!,Surprised
79,Are you a soccer or tennis fan?,Curious to dive deeper
79," Well I personally prefer tennis, but I also like lacrosse, did you hear about the spring all met boys lacrosse team?",Curious to dive deeper
79," No, what was that?",Curious to dive deeper
79," Well they want a lot of Awards this year, and I think they're going to do even better next year",Happy
79,I will have to follow them. Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy,Curious to dive deeper
79," Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous",Surprised
79,That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol,Curious to dive deeper
79,I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined,Curious to dive deeper
79," Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime! ",Curious to dive deeper
79," That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment?",Surprised
79," I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup?",Curious to dive deeper
79,No I don't. I really don't like soccer I think it's boring LOL it's weird to me that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's biggest events,Surprised
79," it is boring, but it is kind of fun to watch one week per 4 years lol. I liked Brazil",Curious to dive deeper
79," Well soccer is a good exercise though, apparently a player will run about 7 miles per game, that's good for burning calories",Surprised
79," so good, they always have tight bodies lol. There was a german soccer player who donated 300000 euros to help pay for surgeries in brazil",Curious to dive deeper
79," That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA? Apparently it's because they can't grow green grass LOL",Surprised
79," lol, that is a valid point but don't you think they could use turf? That is a little wrong i think ",Curious to dive deeper
79," Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?",Curious to dive deeper
79,I didn't what was that?,Curious to dive deeper
79," I was asking about the longest point in pro tennis, apparently it lasted for 29 minute straight, it was a 600 shot rally, that's incredible",Surprised
79," Wow, great chatting with you!",Curious to dive deeper
80,Hello,Curious to dive deeper
80,Hi. Do you play tennis?,Curious to dive deeper
80," I used to and love it.  Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players",Curious to dive deeper
80,I once watched a match where single point lasted nearly 30 minutes. It was historic,Neutral
80," Wow, They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open",Curious to dive deeper
80,I remember when players could use just about everything for a racket except the kitchen sink,Neutral
80," Haha, The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.",Curious to dive deeper
80,Do you know who played in that match?,Neutral
80," No, I sure don't.  I bet they were worn out though.",Curious to dive deeper
80,Tennis players make quite a bit of money if they win a tournament but not as much as soccer players,Neutral
80," Yes, they do.  On another note, did you know that the rapper drake graduated high school on october 2012 at the age of 25",Happy
80,That is a little late isn't it or do Canadians graduate at a later age?,Curious to dive deeper
80," Haha, that is very late.  Probably a ssllooww learner.  The beat of drake's song ""hotline bling"" is actually sampled from timmy thomas' 1972 hit ""why we can't live together"".",Curious to dive deeper
80,I absolutely love his music!,Happy
80," During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an Obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books  Charlotte's web' and  Winnie the pooh'.",Surprised
80,I wonder why he would do that. He doesn't seem like he is into reading seeing as though he graduated high school so late,Surprised
80," Good question.  After hearing eminem's verse on drake's song forever, kanye west took two days and cancelled appointments to rewrite his.",Curious to dive deeper
80,Didn't Drake do some acting when he was younger?,Curious to dive deeper
80,Yes.  Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s.,Surprised
80," They named a college after him too, didn't they?",Neutral

81,Seems like a huge expense lol,Neutral

82,Probably but not in serious competitions. A tennis player actually invented the polo! Who knew!,Surprised
82," Lol, that is pretty funny, and now they have the polo players on there, I bet the company wants people to think they invented them. ",Curious to dive deeper
82," The player was Rene ""The crocodile"" lacoste. His company uses the alligator and is called Lacoste still!",Surprised

83,Its a great musical instrument,Happy
83,This is true. That statement also goes well with piano's. There's so many talented artists out there that can play the piano and guitar.

85,Whoa!  His playing was literally on fire.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks.,Happy
85,That's cool I've heard of people using coins before.,Surprised
85,It probably would give it a different sound I would think since you're strumming the strings with a metal and not plastic pick.,Surprised
85,I bet you're right on that. He also has a PHD in astrophysics.,Surprised
85,Interesting.  The guitarist from Pink Floyd turned a houseboat into a recording studio.  Crazy stuff.,Happy
85,That's funny. A group climb Britain's highest mountain back in 2006 and found a piano on top.,Surprised
85,I couldn't even imagine the ordeal it would have been for whomever had to take that piano up there originally.  An aluminum grand piano weighs 356 pounds and that's light compared to a regular piano.,Surprised

86," True. Cornell university researchers built the world's smallest guitar,played by a laser, about the size of a red blood cell. I bet Brian May could figure out a way to play that guitar.",Neutral
86,I bet he can he can put that PHD in astrophysics and his mad skills as a guitarist to work I think his one of the greatest of all time,Curious to dive deeper
86,The bio-pic of Freddie Mercury did well at the Oscars. Rami Malek won Best Actor. I guess Queen is finally getting recognized by Hollywood.,Neutral

89,have you ever heard about a mute man from england that could only communicate to others with a piano,Fearful

90,I am good thanks. How are you?,Curious to dive deeper
90,I'm doing groovy over here. Are you a fan of tennis?,Neutral
90,Not so much. I heard that the longest tennis match in history went on for 11 hours. I definitely would not want to watch that.,Disgusted
90,What if you had money on it though? That would make it worth it.,Neutral
90,I think I would be more interested in the helicopter that dried the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.,Surprised
90,I guess hair dryers were not powerful enough then. A helicopter? That's a rich person's solution.,Neutral
90," And wait, grass tennis court? I wonder how well the ball bounced. Probaby grass cut really short but still.",Curious to dive deeper
90," Yeah, there are three kinds of courts. I guess grass has its effect on the ball. Do you use Google much?",Curious to dive deeper
90," Oh yeah, more than I shoud. I know I'm not the only one. In 2013 Google went down for five minutes and took 40 percent of web traffic with it.",Surprised
90," People are so dependent on the Internet. If civilization collapsed, the first thing they would do is search Google for a solution.",Neutral
90," Kind of related, but I have totally tried to Google things when my power is out. Haha.",Curious to dive deeper
90,We can't help it! Easy to get knowledge that provides answers to daily problems. Not there when I was a kid.,Neutral
90," Google's unofficial slogal is ""Don't be evil"" but I sometimes think it is evil. They calculate traffic by tracking how fast Android devices are moving on the road.",Fearful
90," They are spying on us, even right now! But they do like dogs, which is pretty good right there.",Neutral
90,And they did hire live goats to mow their lawns once. That is pretty kewl.,Surprised
90,I would become a goat there if it got me stock options.,Neutral
90," Haha. So speaking of Google, I just Googled Borg vs. McEnroe. It is about one of the greatest tennis games ever played. Would you watch it?",Curious to dive deeper
90,I would watch. I don't think I'd bet on the outcome though. Isn't there some movie about them two?,Curious to dive deeper
90,Yes I think that is the title. Shia LaBeouf stars as McEnroe. I am not really too into sports movies.,Curious to dive deeper
90,It's probably mostly about personalities. McEnroe was intense. Borg was Swedish. That's enough personality for one film.,Neutral
90," Haha, hilarious. I will have to check it out!",Surprised
91,Hello!  Are you a tennis fan or do you play?,Happy
91," No, my dad used to, though. It seems like it's too intense for me",Neutral
91,I only tried playing in college to kill time.  I stunk up the courts I was so bad.  The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days.  Crazy.,Happy
91," Was that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon?",Curious to dive deeper
91,I'm not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.  Bet that dried it fast.,Happy
91,That was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since,Neutral
91,Wow.  I didn't know that.  Polo shirts were originally invented by a tennis player and were later adopted by polo players.  Interesting.,Happy
91,So maybe we should really be calling them tennis shirts? Just like sneakers are often called tennis shoes,Neutral
91,lol  Good point!  They say that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  I question that... lol,Happy
91,Same. How do people know? How many pairs have survived since then? And what constitutes better performance?,Curious to dive deeper
91,I have no idea.  I bet those would be some smelly shoes though!  They say putting a dry tea bag inside smelly shoes will absorb the unpleasant odor.  I'll have to try that to try that on my smelly stinky shoes. Lol lol,Surprised
91," Oh wow, I never knew that. I actually have a huge problem with that, so that will help. Surprised I didn't learn that when I googled solutions to that problem (which I've done like 100 times)",Surprised
91,I'm a big googler myself.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon. Crazy how far technology has come since then.,Happy
91," I can't even begin to understand how that makes sense. Then again, I guess computing was done a lot by people by hand back in the 60's",Surprised
91,When google went down for 5 minutes in 2013 it took 40 percent of the web traffic with it.  I don't remember that.,Happy
91," I don't remember that either, but it makes sense. Did you know that Google as a company officially prefers dogs over cats?!",Surprised
91,I didn't know that.  I know at one time they used hundreds of live goats to mow the lawns around their headquarters.  They really like their animals.,Happy
91," Yeah! I guess it wasn't too cost effective to do that with the goats, otherwise they'd keep doing it. Pretty energy efficient, though",Neutral
91,I agree!  Good was founded in 1998.  I could have sworn I remember using it before then.,Happy
91,I remember being told about it by a teacher in 1999 or 2000. Like I remember her writing it on the board and another teacher telling us it was an intentional misspelling of the number googol,Neutral
91,Interesting!  I have to get going.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a good night!,Happy
92," Hello, do you follow tennis?",Curious to dive deeper
92,Not really. I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball.,Neutral
92,Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis?,Surprised
92," I did know. I know Lacoste shirts had the crocodile and it was a symbol for Rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste who was a famous player.",Curious to dive deeper
92,Yep. A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since.,Surprised
92,Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open.,Surprised
92,I agree. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.,Surprised
92," Yes, they did. The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours over three days. I bet they were exhausted!",Surprised
92,That's crazy long!,Surprised
92,I agree! It's amazing the facts you can find on Google. Did you know that a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon?,Surprised
92,That's pretty amazing! I saw that Google maps calculates traffic by how fast Android devices are moving on the road.,Surprised
92,I never knew that! I wonder whose? I know I heard that back in the day Google used goats to keep the lawn under control instead of hiring people to mow.,Surprised
92,That's hilarious! Google went down for 5 minutes back in 2013 and took 40% of the web traffic with it.,Surprised
92,I can imagine. I use it a lot. It's hard to believe its only been around since 1998.,Surprised
92," I agree. When there is a dispute on a border, Google maps tailors the map to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located.",Surprised
92,That sounds logical. I wish I would have gotten on board with the 2004 initial public offering to buy stock. I can't even imagine the outcome.,Surprised

95,Did you watch the movie?  Was it really a space movie?,Curious to dive deeper
95,I haven't seen it yet.  Today was the first time I heard of it.,Curious to dive deeper
95,It is hard to talk about this movie if we both have not seen it.  Can we change the topic?,Curious to dive deeper
95,Let's talk about Earth.  It's the third planet from the sun.,Curious to dive deeper
95," Apparently, 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.  It's depressing to me.",Curious to dive deeper
95,That is sad for sure.  Sad that people are the cause of it too.,Curious to dive deeper
95," When the earth was first formed, there was only 5.5 hours long in a day.  ",Surprised
95,Wow.  I didn't know that.  71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by water.  I wonder what covers the polar regions?,Curious to dive deeper
95," Ice?  I am not sure though.  Apparently, earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century.",Curious to dive deeper

95,Do you like Starship Troopers?,Happy

95,I have no idea.  lol  The word robotics was made up by a book writer - Isaac Asimov.  Seems like robots and space are always a big theme for science fiction books and movies.,Happy
95," By the way, do you know that the United Nations appointed an ambassador to greet extraterrestrials in case they want to say hello to us?",Curious to dive deeper
95," That's interesting!  What a job to have!  That's just like something out of the movie Star Wars, which came out in 1977 and the value of that franchise is now $65 billion dollar! ",Happy
95,Wow.  That is a lot of money.  I heard that it is currently the 5th largest grossing media franchise.,Surprised
95,Initially 20th century fox was convinced that Star Wars was going to be a flop.  Wow we're they wrong.,Surprised
95,They were wrong indeed.  George Lucas got a better deal by forgoing $500k directing fee.,Surprised
95," James Earl Jones only made $7,500 for 2 1/2 hours of work providing the voice for Darth Vader.  Thought he would have spent more time and made more money recording that voice.",Surprised
95,I do not think $7500 is a lot of money to provide Darth Vader's voice because the movie was very successful.  What do you think?,Curious to dive deeper
95,I wonder if the actors get any royalties from the movie?,Surprised
95,They should.  George Lucas should be generous since he got so much money from Star Wars.,Curious to dive deeper
95,You would think!  He's a billionaire from the movie!,Surprised
95,Rich people are often cheap.,Sad
95,That's sad...but so true.  I've seen it too much during my working lifetime where the people at the top get richer and the workers on the factory floor just barely have enough money to live on.,Curious to dive deeper

96," I like dogs more, but dont mind cats! Google likes dogs more though",Curious to dive deeper
96,Hah. I see their code of conduct state they are a DOG company.,Curious to dive deeper
96," lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though!",Curious to dive deeper
96,Kinda odd since dogs are normally louder and more likely to poop somewhere. Looks like Istanbul even has vending machines to release food and water for strays.,Curious to dive deeper
96," that is a great point! The US needs to get those vending machines, I would donate so many plastic bottles. That is nice of that country",Curious to dive deeper
96,I wonder where else the dogs go if not for vencing machines?,Curious to dive deeper
96," right, they probably go for trash cans unfortunately. Did you know dogs have 12 types of blood?",Curious to dive deeper
96,Makes sense for variety. Apparently they have doggie blood drives too!,Curious to dive deeper
96," that would be so awesome to volunteer at. I will have to look them up. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing, sorry cats",Curious to dive deeper
96," My cats responding to pointing, and throwing.",Curious to dive deeper
96," That is true, so I wonder if there are more we don't know about lol. Do you like horses at all?",Curious to dive deeper
96,I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you?,Curious to dive deeper
96," They are so beautiful, I like petting them but never rode one. I wouldn't ride Icelandic horses because they are super fast.",Curious to dive deeper
96,I wonder if riders trained horses to do that?,Curious to dive deeper
96,I am sure they did. I just wouldn't ride horses to school on no vehicle day and get suspended like two students did. I feel that was pointless,Curious to dive deeper
96,That's funny and rather stupid at the same time.,Curious to dive deeper
96," For sure lol, it was so nice talking with you, say hi to your cats for me!",Curious to dive deeper
96," My cats will run away, but sure!",Curious to dive deeper
96,lol! bye now!,Curious to dive deeper
97,Crazy that early humans used to have to battle giant sloths! Who would've thought?,Surprised
97," I know right! Humans have been around for a long time apparently I mean we lost our body hair 240,000 years ago!",Surprised
97," Yea that's really interesting. I never knew humans could regrow a rib bone that has been surgically shortened, either.",Curious to dive deeper
97,No I didn't know that either. I wonder if other animals can do that? Like can we Harvest Pig ribs for food and then they will regrow that way we don't have to kill the pig haha,Curious to dive deeper
97,That would be awesome! I'm sure science will figure that out someday! We can already use our current technology to date the extinction of ground sloths and determine where ancient human footprints led to.,Curious to dive deeper
97,That's really cool. I would love to see that. They should put that in the movie! I think it's cool that humans are adapted for persistence running. We are some of the best animals in the world at it,Surprised
97,Haha yea that would be cool. That's really surprising humans are the best at persistence running! I wouldn't have guessed that. As long as those pesky hiccups don't attack while running! Darn evolution leftovers!,Curious to dive deeper
97," Haha yep hiccups are so annoying! So is that frequency that causes fear in humans ,have you heard about that LOL?",Curious to dive deeper
97," No, I had not. So fear comes from sound...? I thought it had to do with the autonomic nervous system, fight or flight thing? That would be really interesting to look into further. ",Surprised
97,Can come from sound. And yes I'm going to look into that further as well. Do you like any animals by the way?,Curious to dive deeper
97," I used to own two cats, no current pets though. I would love to go to Japan and play with some cats at a cat cafe though! haha",Curious to dive deeper
97,Haha that does seem like a great idea! Get a drink and pet a cat LOL. Did you know that a cat will spend 10 years of its life sleeping when it's only 15 years old LOL that's a long time,Surprised
97," That is nuts! What I wouldn't give to trade places! Or trade places with Stubbs, the cat who is the mayor of Talkeentna, Alaska! Sounds like a sweet gig.",Curious to dive deeper
97,It does sound awesome! I don't know what kind of work she does but she must be doing a great job lol have you ever seen the movie The Godfather by the way,Curious to dive deeper
97,Right? Haha And yea I've seen the Godfather but it's been a while.,Curious to dive deeper
97," Well in the opening scene the cat that they use, I don't know if you remember that part, but it was actually a stray apparently",Surprised
97," Yea, I vaguely remember, that's awesome. Another sweet gig for a cat! Now if only I woulda thought to have one of my cats coauthor a book with me. I guess some physicist did so so that he could use the first person plural without being criticized!",Curious to dive deeper
97,That is funny! What do you think about Scotland putting a lot in place to protect the Loch Ness monster? Do you think that means he might exist LOL,Curious to dive deeper
97," Haha that is strange. It definitely makes one wonder...maybe the loch ness is some super secret scientific experiment or military weapon? Haha I guess thanks to the Germans, who in 2002 were the first to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights, Scotland can do what it wants concerning the Loch Ness!",Curious to dive deeper
97,The Loch Ness monster should have legal rights to! Did you know that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet Earth. I have no idea how many zeros that is but I know it is a lot LOL,Happy
97,Haha that is insane. How does anyone even figure out that there's that many animals?! Interesting that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead. I wonder what that's about?,Curious to dive deeper
97," I know right. like will a fish get a patch of white on its forehead?the only animals that have that that I've ever seen our dogs, so I just don't know LOL",Surprised
98," Hi, Do you like to cook?",Curious to dive deeper
98,I love to cook. just not in july when it is so hot.,Curious to dive deeper
98," Right, it's no fun when it is hot and you're trying to cook. We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot.",Curious to dive deeper
98,Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot.,Curious to dive deeper
98," Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all.",Curious to dive deeper
98,That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave.,Neutral
98," The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans.",Curious to dive deeper
98,We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken.,Happy
98," Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat.",Curious to dive deeper
98,I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool.,Happy
98," Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing?",Curious to dive deeper
98,I love to fish. the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old,Surprised
98," Wow that is a long life for a goldfish! I like to go crabbing too. I heard the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, I",Surprised
98,THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years,Happy
98,Whoa! That is crazy to know and interesting. I know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.,Surprised
98,Cool the barreleye fish has a transparent head.,Curious to dive deeper
98," Awesome. I heard that saltwater fish dink water through their mouths and through their skin, while a freshwater fish only drinks through their skin. Fish are fascinating.",Surprised
98,That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch?,Surprised
98," There are times when i Do like to look at the birds, how about you? Did you know that birds bones are really hollow. So hollow in fact that their skeleton weighs less than their feathers.",Curious to dive deeper
98,thats neat. They have then thousand living species.,Surprised
98," That's cool. Some birds are known to fly from Alaska to mexico without sleeping, that is tiring to think about.",Surprised
98,o wow. I wonder how many days that takes. Scientist say birds have regional accents.,Curious to dive deeper
98," That is cool how they even have accents like humans. My favorite is the hummingbird, they are tiny sometimes about 2 inches long.",Surprised
98,They are the smallest birds and the ostrich is the biggest. Some birds don't fly.,Surprised
98,This reminds me of the extinct dodo bird. They were actually a sub-family of pigeons.,Curious to dive deeper
98,pigeons are one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young.,Surprised
98,Very cool. Pigeons are very pretty birds.,Happy
99,Hi do you like tennis?,Curious to dive deeper

99,Nice!  Did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and only later adopted by polo players?,Happy
99," Ha! That's weird! I didn't know that! Tennis has an interesting history. Did you know that until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket?",Surprised
99,Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since.,Happy
99," Wow! Not since 1968? You know, Serena Williams has increasingly found her voice and spoken out against gender and racial inequality. ",Happy
99," Yes!  Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus!",Happy
99," She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. That means she won at least one Australian Open title, French Open title, Wimbledon title, US Open title, and Olympic Gold medal.",Happy
99,That's pretty incredible!  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.,Happy
99," That's a little before Serena's time! Although, did you know she went pro in tennis at the age of 13?! I could barely even get a ball over the net when I was 13!",Surprised
99,lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport.,Happy
99," That is for sure! Two girls from Compton came and conquered! In total, Serena has been Number 1 for 319 weeks! ",Surprised
99,That is incredible!  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  Wow!,Happy
99,Are you kidding me! Three days?! That's a long time! I don't have that kind of patience! Speaking of long records... did you know the longest point in pro tennis history was a 643 shot rally?,Surprised
99,Wow!  That would have been fun to watch...not so fun for the players. lol,Happy
99," Yeah! It lasted 29 minutes! I bet it was pretty exhilarating, but also probably pretty exhausting! I would certainly be out of breath after 29 minutes!",Surprised
99,lol me too.  Are you a fan of rap music?,Curious to dive deeper
99," Oh yeah! Tennis reminds me a little of rap, since they're both so fast paced. Did you know the world's fastest rapper can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second?",Curious to dive deeper
99,Holy smokes I wouldn't be able to listen that fast!  lol  It's been fun chatting with you!,Happy
99," Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark. He rhymes in sign language! You don't have to listen at all! I'm going to go try to find some on the internet. Goodbye!",Neutral
99,I'll have to look him up!  Have a great night!,Happy
